## Network Architecture

### LAN Architectures & Campus LAN Design

Network topologies describe the arrangement of elements (links, nodes, etc.) of a communication network. Common topologies include Mesh, Partial Mesh, Hybrid Mesh, and Star Topology.

#### 1. The Two-Tier LAN Design

The Two-Tier LAN Design consists of 2 hierarchical layers:
* **Access Layer:** This is the layer that end hosts connect to. Access Layer Switches typically have many ports. QoS marking is typically done here (early stage in a packet's life), and security services like Port Security, DAI (Dynamic ARP Inspection), and DHCP snooping are implemented. Switchports might be PoE-enabled for wireless APs, IP phones, etc.
* **Distribution Layer:** This layer aggregates connections from the Access Layer, providing fault-tolerant interconnections between different Access Blocks. It's typically placed at the border between Layer 2 and Layer 3 (routing). Distribution Layer switches implement traffic policies, routing boundaries, filtering, and QoS. They connect to services like WAN and the Internet. In a collapsed core design, the Distribution Layer is sometimes called the Core-Distribution Layer. Connections between Distribution Layer 3 switches are Layer 3. Routing information can be shared via OSPF, for example.

This design is also known as a **collapsed core design** because it omits a layer found in the Three-Tier Design.

**Topology within a Two-Tier Design:**
* At the Access Layer, many devices connect to Access Switches in a **Star Topology** (with DAI, Port Security, DHCP snooping implemented).
* At the intersection between the Access Layer and the Distribution Layer, we typically have a **Partial Mesh Topology** (leveraging STP and HSRP for redundancy).
* Between the Distribution Layer 3 Switches (if multiple), a **Full Mesh Topology** might be used for redundancy and load balancing.
* All together, this forms a **Hybrid Topology**.

In larger networks with many Distribution Layer switches (e.g., separate building facilities in a campus or a research lab), the number of mesh connections required between Distribution L3 Switches grows rapidly, leading to scalability complications. Cisco recommends adding a Core Layer if there are more than 3 Distribution Layers in a single location. Each Distribution Layer switch then connects to a Core Layer, eliminating the need for full mesh interconnection between them.

#### 2. Three-Tier LAN Design

The Three-Tier LAN Design consists of 3 hierarchical layers: Access, Distribution/Aggregation, and Core.
* **Core Layer:** This layer connects Distribution Layers together in large LAN networks. The focus is speed and fast transport. CPU-intensive operations such as security, QoS classification, and marking should be avoided at this layer. Connections are all Layer 3; therefore, there's no use for Spanning Tree Protocol. The Core Layer should maintain connectivity throughout the LAN even if devices fail. They connect to the Internet/Edge Router/Top Router used in traditional on-premises data centers (often using LACP, PAgP for link aggregation). This is also referred to as **North-South traffic**.

#### 3. Spine & Leaf Architecture

The Spine & Leaf Architecture is an advanced Two-Tier Design that provides better support for SDN Overlay Networks. Traditional data center designs used the Three-Tier Design, but it worked well when most traffic was North-South (traffic going in or out of the data center) and didn't function well for **East-West Traffic** (traffic between servers in the same part of the network).

With the precedence of virtual servers, applications are often deployed in a distributed manner, which increases the amount of East-West traffic in a data center. The traditional Three-Tier designs led to bottlenecks in bandwidth as well as variability in server-to-server latency depending on the path the traffic takes. To resolve this, Spine-Leaf Architecture has become prominent in data centers.

**Key characteristics of Spine & Leaf Architecture:**
* Every Leaf switch is connected to every Spine Switch.
* Every Spine Switch is connected to every Leaf Switch.
* Leaf switches do not connect to other Leaf switches.
* Spine switches do not connect to other Spine switches.
* End hosts only connect to Leaf switches.

The path taken by traffic is chosen randomly to balance the load, and each end host is separated by the same number of hops, providing consistent latency.

### WAN Architecture Design

To extend networks over a large geographical area, we use WANs (Wide Area Networks). Although internal traffic can be considered WAN, the term WAN is typically used to refer to an enterprise's private connections that link their offices, data centers, and other sites together. Over a public or shared network like the Internet, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can be used to create private connections between multiple LANs to a centralized WAN in a star topology style known as **Hub and Spoke Architecture**.

Each LAN can be connected to the WAN data center via a Telco/Comms/Leased Line in a Star Topology. This is similar to how on-premise data centers/LANs connect to a Cloud Provider WAN, like ExpressRoute or Direct Connect.

#### 1. Leased Line

A Leased Line is a dedicated physical link, typically connecting 2 sites, or multiple sites to a central hub. There are various standards that provide different speeds, and different standards are available in different countries.
Leased lines use Serial Connections (Point-to-Point Protocol and High-Level Data Link Control - HDLC) Encapsulation. Due to the higher cost, higher installation lead time, and slower speeds of leased lines, Ethernet WAN technologies are becoming more popular. A leased line is dedicated, so there is no need for MPLS labels.

#### 2. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Circuits

MPLS networks are shared infrastructure because many customers/enterprises connect to and share the same infrastructure to make WAN Connections. The Label Switching in the term MPLS allows VPNs to be created over the MPLS infrastructure through the use of **LABELS**. Labels are used to separate the traffic of different customers as it travels over the shared infrastructure, ensuring it doesn't mix or congest with traffic from other customers.

* **CE Router (Customer Edge Router):** Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) at the customer's site.
* **PE Router (Provider Edge Router):** Connects directly to CE Routers and is the entry/exit point of the MPLS network for customer traffic.
* **P Router (Provider Core Router):** Forms the internal network infrastructure of the service provider's network but doesn't connect directly to the Customer Edge Routers.

When frames are received on the PE Routers from the CE Routers, they add a label to the frame. This label is placed in-between the Layer 2 Ethernet Header and the Layer 3 IP layer (effectively, Layer 2.5). These labels are used to make forwarding decisions within the Service Provider Network. MPLS Routers use the MPLS Label to decide where to forward the packet rather than a Routing table. CE Routers do not use MPLS; it's only used by the Provider Edge and Provider Core Routers.

When using MPLS VPNs, the CE and PE Routers peer using OSPF to share routing information. The customer may even decide to use static routes with the PE Router as the next-hop.

A Layer 2 MPLS VPN could be used in place of OSPF. In this manner, the CE-PE do not form peers. The Service Provider network is entirely transparent to the CE Routers. In effect, or logically, it's like the 2 CE Routers are directly connected; their WAN Interfaces will be in the same subnet. If a routing protocol is used, the 2 CE Routers will peer directly with each other, making the PE/P Routers act as one big switch.

MPLS stands apart from other WAN Services due to its provision of effective QoS features. It provides a Layer 3 service to customers. MPLS itself is sometimes called a Layer 2.5 protocol because it adds the MPLS Header between the data-link header (Layer 2) & the IP header (Layer 3).

The SP's MPLS VPN Network (between the Provider Edge Routers - PE and the Provider Core Routers - P) will use a routing protocol to build routing protocol relationships with customer routers (CE). It will learn customer subnets/routes with those routing protocol relationships (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP, RIPv2). It will advertise a customer's routes with a routing protocol so that all routers that a customer connects to the MPLS VPN can learn all routes as advertised through the MPLS VPN Network.

All the Customer Edge Routers (CE) need to learn routes from the other CE routers. However, a CE Router does not form routing protocol neighbor relationships directly with other CE Routers. The process solely relies on the Provider Edge Routers (PE) and their PE-CE routing protocol neighborhood. To advertise the customer routes between the PE Routers, the PE Routers use another routing protocol along with a process called **Route Redistribution**. This happens when one router takes routes from one routing protocol process and injects them into another. Redistribution is needed when the PE-CE routing protocol is not BGP.

A Router PE.1 might sit in one Point of Presence (PoP) but connect to different customers. Likewise, Router PE.2 might connect to many of those same customers. These Routers use **VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)** to facilitate turning one single router into multiple virtual routers, each with its own Routing Table.
**MP-BGP (Multiprotocol BGP)** can mark which routes are from which customers so that only the correct routes are advertised to each CE router for that customer. WAN Routes on the CE Routers refer to the neighboring PE Router as the next-hop router, with each CE Router becoming a routing protocol neighbor with the SP's PE Router on the other end of the Access Link.

### Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

When it comes to Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity, solutions based on Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) or Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) that utilize the public internet as the transport network can suffer from unpredictable performance levels. Many organizations, especially in corporate settings, prefer **Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)** as a means of establishing private links with guaranteed service levels.

MPLS operates as an **overlay network**, meaning it can configure point-to-point or point-to-multipoint links between network nodes regardless of the underlying physical and data-link layer topologies. This makes it a very flexible and powerful solution for WAN providers.

#### How MPLS Works

Imagine you have two customer premises (CPE) routers at different sites, Site I and Site II, that need to communicate through an MPLS provider's cloud.

1.  **Label Edge Router (LER) - Ingress:** The CPE Router at Site I is attached to the service provider's MPLS cloud via an **Ingress Label Edge Router (LER)**.
2.  **Label Insertion (Push):** The Ingress LER acts as the entry point into the MPLS network. It inspects the incoming packet's Layer 3 header (e.g., IPv4 or IPv6) and, based on forwarding equivalence classes (FECs) and pre-configured policies, **inserts (pushes) a shim header (containing a label)** into each packet.
3.  **Label Switched Routers (LSRs):** The packet, now with its label, is forwarded to an **Label Switched Router (LSR)** within the MPLS cloud.
4.  **Label Switched Path (LSP):** Each LSR in the path examines only the label (the "shim"). It determines the **Label Switched Path (LSP)** for the packet, based on the type of data, network congestion, and other traffic engineering parameters determined by the service provider. Crucially, it uses this label to forward the packet to its next neighbor, rather than performing complex Layer 3 header lookups. This process is called **label swapping** (the LSR removes the incoming label and applies a new outgoing label). By avoiding costly routing table lookups at each hop, MPLS significantly speeds up packet forwarding.
5.  **Label Edge Router (LER) - Egress:** The labeled packet continues traversing the LSRs until it reaches the **Egress LER** (the exit point from the MPLS network).
6.  **Label Removal (Pop):** The Egress LER **removes (pops) the label** from the packet and then delivers the original Layer 3 packet to the destination CPE Router (e.g., at Site II).

#### Benefits of MPLS

MPLS allows WAN providers to offer various robust solutions for enterprise networking requirements:

* **Guaranteed Service Levels:** MPLS providers can apply traffic shaping policies to communication between enterprise LANs and data centers. This enables them to guarantee specific service levels, ensuring predictable performance for critical applications.
* **Enhanced Reliability and Redundancy:** Providers can implement link redundancy within their MPLS cloud, making connections much more reliable than those over the open Internet.
* **Site-to-Site VPNs:** A primary use of MPLS is to create site-to-site VPNs to interconnect LANs or connect branch offices to a data center.
* **Traffic Isolation:** Traffic passing over an MPLS VPN is isolated from any other customer traffic or public internet traffic, enhancing security and privacy. **It is crucial to understand that MPLS VPNs do NOT use the public internet as the transport network; they operate over the service provider's private infrastructure.**
* **Flexible Access Methods:** Different sites can use any available access method (e.g., DSL, cellular, leased line, Ethernet) to connect to the MPLS cloud.
* Many protocols can be used to connect to an SP's MPLS Network: Metro Ethernet / Fiber Links, Cable Provider Links (CATV), Serial Lines, 4G/5G, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL).
* **Flexible Topologies:** Sites can utilize point-to-point or point-to-multipoint topologies as required, offering greater design flexibility than traditional VPNs.

### Metro Ethernet

**Metro Ethernet (MetroE)** service uses Ethernet physical links to connect the customer's device to the service provider's device. The service is a Layer 2 service in that the WAN provider forwards Ethernet frames from one customer device to another, acting as though the WAN service was created by one Ethernet switch. Each Customer Edge device (be it a Router or Layer 3 Switch) connects to the service with (at least) one Ethernet link (preferably Fiber Ethernet standards) rather than connecting directly to other customer (enterprise) routers. The physical link between the customer and the SP is called an Access Link, or when using Ethernet, an Ethernet Access Link.

#### MetroE Service Types (Topology)

* **Ethernet Line Service (point-to-point):** Two Customer Premise Equipment can exchange frames. This is similar in concept to a leased line.
* **Ethernet LAN Service (full-mesh):** Acts like a LAN; all devices can send frames to all other devices. All devices have to be in the same subnet and become OSPF neighbors.
* **Ethernet Tree Service (Hub-n-Spoke):** A central site can communicate to a defined set of remote sites, but the remote sites cannot communicate directly with each other. This is also referred to as "partial mesh, point-multipoint, hub-and-spoke."

## Network Types and Characteristics

A network comprises **nodes** and **links**.
* **Intermediate system nodes** perform a forwarding function (e.g., routers, switches).
* **End system nodes** are those that send and receive traffic, classified either as clients or servers.

* **Server:** A server makes network applications and resources available to other hosts.
* **Client:** A client requests and consumes the services provided by the servers.

### Client-Server Network

* A network where some end system nodes act mostly as servers.
* Servers are typically more powerful computers.
* Application services and resources are centrally provisioned, managed, and secured.
* This model is common in corporate environments.

### Peer-to-Peer Network

* A network where each end system acts as both a client and a server.
* This is a decentralized model where the provisioning, management, and security of services and data are distributed around the network.
* Common in small home networks or file-sharing applications.

### Network Type by Scope and Size

A network type refers primarily to its **scope** and **size**.
* **Size:** Can be measured by the number of nodes.
* **Scope:** Refers to the area over which nodes sharing the same network are distributed.

1.  **Local Area Network (LAN):**
    * Describes a network type confined to a single geographical location (e.g., a home, small office/home office (SOHO), small/medium enterprise (SME) network, enterprise LAN, or data center).
    * The term **Campus Area Network (CAN)** is sometimes used for a LAN that spans multiple nearby buildings within a limited geographical area.
    * The term **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** is used for LANs based on wireless technology (e.g., Wi-Fi hotspots).

2.  **Wide Area Network (WAN):**
    * Describes a "network of networks" connected by long-distance links.
    * A WAN connects two or more large LANs.
    * WANs are likely to use leased network devices and links, operated and managed by a service provider.
    * The term **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** is sometimes used for a network smaller than a WAN in scope, typically a city-wide network encompassing multiple different buildings.

3.  **Personal Area Network (PAN) and Wireless PAN (WPAN):**
    * Gaining traction as the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves.
    * Refer to close-range network links a person might establish between a variety of wearable or portable devices (e.g., Bluetooth devices, smartwatches, fitness trackers).

## Network Topology

A **network topology** describes the physical or logical structure of the network in terms of **nodes** and **links**.

1.  **Physical Structure:** Describes the actual placement of nodes and how they are connected by the network media (e.g., directly connected via a single cable, or connected to a switch via separate cables).
2.  **Logical Structure:** Describes the flow of data through the network, irrespective of the physical structure. Nodes share a logical layout in which they can send messages to one another.

### Common Topologies

* **Point-to-Point Link:**
    * The simplest type of topology where a single link is established between two nodes (a 1:1 relationship).
    * Point-to-point links can be a physical or logical topology. For example, in a WAN, two routers might be physically linked via multiple intermediate networks and physical devices but still share a logical point-to-point link (e.g., a VPN tunnel).

* **Star Topology:**
    * Each endpoint node is connected to a central forwarding node (e.g., a Layer 1 hub, Layer 2 switch, or Layer 3 router).
    * The central node mediates communications between endpoints.
    * **Advantages:**
        * Easy to reconfigure (add/remove nodes).
        * Easy to troubleshoot because all data goes through a central point, which can be used to monitor and manage the network.
        * Faults are isolated to the central node or the link to a specific endpoint.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * A single point of failure at the central device.
        * Requires more cabling than a bus or ring.
    * **Hub-and-Spoke:** This terminology is often used when speaking about WANs with remote branches (spokes) connecting to a central office (hub).
    * **Ethernet deployments:** Modern Ethernet using switches (not hubs) often appear as a **physical star** but operate as a **logical bus** because switches still share a single broadcast domain by default unless VLANs are used. (Note: Deprecated physical bus topology is no longer used on LANs).

* **Mesh Topology:**
    * Each endpoint device has a point-to-point link with every other device on the network.
    * Commonly used in WANs, especially public networks like the Internet.
    * **Fully Connected Mesh:** Impractical for large networks as the number of links required is expressed as $n(n-1)/2$, where $n$ is the number of nodes.
    * **Hybrid Approach (Partial Mesh):** Often implemented, with only the most important devices interconnected in the mesh, perhaps with extra links for fault tolerance and redundancy.
    * **Advantages:**
        * Provides excellent redundancy and fault tolerance.
        * Packets can take multiple routes through the network, providing resilience if some nodes or links fail.
        * Nodes can forward packets to a destination by learning the network topology.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * Complex to implement and manage.
        * High cabling costs for full mesh.

* **Ring Topology:**
    * Each node is wired to its neighbor in a closed loop.
    * Often employs the use of a **token** during transmissions (e.g., Token Ring, FDDI - Fiber Distributed Data Interface, though these are largely obsolete).
    * A node receives a transmission from its upstream neighbor and passes it to its downstream neighbor until the transmission reaches its intended destination.
    * **Advantages:**
        * Each node can regenerate the transmission, improving the potential range of the network.
        * Can cover long distances.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * A break in the ring causes the whole network to fail.
        * **Dual Counter-Rotating Rings** can be used to provide fault tolerance, allowing the system to continue operating if there is a break in one ring.

* **Bus Topology:**
    * All nodes attach directly to a single cable segment (the "bus cable").
    * Signals travel down the bus in both directions from the source and are received by all nodes connected to the segment.
    * The bus is terminated at both ends of the cable to absorb the signal when it has passed all connected devices.
    * Nodes use **collision detection** (e.g., in early Ethernet) to find opportunities to transmit, as they all share the bandwidth of the media. A device recognizes and processes packets addressed to its hardware address or a broadcast address, otherwise, it ignores the packet.
    * **Disadvantages:**
        * No longer in widespread use due to limitations on the maximum number of nodes on a segment of cable.
        * Difficult to reconfigure, as adding or removing nodes can disrupt the entire network.
        * Difficult to troubleshoot, as a cable fault could be anywhere on the segment.
        * A single point of failure if the bus cable is damaged.
    * A bus network allowed cables to be connected using repeaters (which are not considered nodes, just passive devices amplifying signals).
    * A **logical bus topology** is one in which nodes receive the data transmitted all at the same time, regardless of the physical wiring layout (e.g., Ethernet using a hub). However, only one node can transmit at a time, leading to collisions.

* **Hybrid Topology:**
    * Anything using a mixture of point-to-point links or star, mesh, ring, or bus physical or logical topologies.
    * For example, a **Physical Star - Logical Bus** (modern Ethernet with switches by default).
    * Hybrid topologies are often used to implement redundancy and fault tolerance or when connecting local area networks (LANs) to Wide Area Networks (WANs).

### Hierarchical Topologies (Common in Enterprise Networks)

* A **Hierarchical Star / Tree Topology** establishes a parent/child relationship between layers in the hierarchy. Corporate networks are often designed using this overall hierarchy.
* **Links between nodes in the Tree** are referred to as **backbones or trunks** because they aggregate and distribute traffic from multiple areas of the network.

* **Hierarchical Star - Mesh:**
    * Alternatively, parent nodes or nodes at the top of the hierarchy can be configured in a partial or full mesh for redundancy.
    * Switches lower in the hierarchy establish a star topology that connects end systems to the network.
    * This is commonly implemented in a **Three-Tiered Switching Architecture** (Access, Distribution, Core layers).

* **Star of Stars (or Hub-and-Spoke Topology):**
    * A WAN might be configured as a hub-and-spoke between a central office (hub) and branch offices (spokes).
    * Each site (hub and spokes) then implements a star topology locally to connect end systems.

* **Star with Rings:**
    * Alternatively, a ring topology might be used to connect geographically separate sites.
    * Each site then implements a star topology locally to connect end systems.

### How Network Topology Affects Performance

Network topology significantly impacts a network's performance, reliability, and scalability:

* **Star Topology (Switched Ethernet):**
    * **Performance:** Excellent. Each device has a dedicated connection to the switch, meaning no collisions between devices connected to different ports. Bandwidth is not shared on a segment-by-segment basis.
    * **Reliability:** High. A failure of one device or its cable doesn't affect others. The central switch is a single point of failure, but modern switches are highly reliable.
    * **Scalability:** Good. Easy to add new devices by connecting them to an available port.
* **Mesh Topology:**
    * **Performance:** Very high. Multiple paths for data allow for load balancing and avoiding congested links.
    * **Reliability:** Extremely high. Redundant paths ensure network continues to operate even if multiple links or nodes fail.
    * **Scalability:** Good, but full mesh becomes impractical very quickly as 'n' increases due to cabling and port requirements. Partial mesh scales better.
* **Ring Topology (Historical):**
    * **Performance:** Deterministic access (e.g., token passing) can provide predictable performance, but adding devices could slow down the ring.
    * **Reliability:** Low for a single ring (one break can take down the whole network). High for dual rings.
    * **Scalability:** Limited, adding/removing devices typically requires taking down the ring.
* **Bus Topology (Historical):**
    * **Performance:** Poor. Shared medium means only one device can transmit at a time, leading to collisions and significant performance degradation as more devices are added.
    * **Reliability:** Low. A single cable break takes down the entire segment.
    * **Scalability:** Very poor. Limited number of devices and difficult to add/remove.
* **Hybrid/Hierarchical Topologies:**
    * **Performance:** Optimized. Allows for specialized equipment at different layers (e.g., high-speed core routers, high-density access switches) to handle traffic efficiently.
    * **Reliability:** Very high. Redundancy can be built into higher layers (e.g., mesh at core/distribution) while simplifying access.
    * **Scalability:** Excellent. Networks can be expanded by adding more access layer devices or entire new network modules.

In summary, choosing the right network type and topology, combined with appropriate Layer 1, 2, and 3 functions, is critical for designing a network that meets specific performance, reliability, security, and scalability requirements.

## Chapter 16: Troubleshooting & Information Gathering Tools

This chapter details various network troubleshooting and information-gathering tools, focusing on their functionality and typical use cases.

## Basic Network Utilities (Command Line)

### `ping`

The `ping` command is used to test network connectivity to a remote host. It sends **ICMP ECHO_REQUEST** packets (Type 8) and expects **ICMP ECHO_REPLY** packets (Type 0) in return.

* **Syntax:**
    * `ping <IP_Address>`: To test connectivity to a specific IP address.
    * `ping <Hostname>`: To test connectivity to a domain name, also implicitly testing DNS resolution.
* **Specific Uses:**
    * `ping localhost` or `ping 127.0.0.1`: Can be used to diagnose issues related to a network card failure. If successful, the network stack on the local machine is functioning.
    * `ping DomainName`: Helps identify internet domain name resolution issues (DNS problems). If ping to IP works but to domain name fails, it indicates a DNS problem.
* **Packet Information:** `ping` displays the **Round Trip Time (RTT)** in milliseconds, indicating latency, and the **Time-to-Live (TTL)** value of the received packet.
    * **Time-to-Live (TTL):** A field in the IP header that is decremented by one by each router (hop) that forwards the packet. When TTL reaches 0, the packet is discarded, preventing indefinite looping. The TTL value in the `ping` response indicates how many hops the packet took to reach the destination.
* **Errors:**
    * "Destination host Unreachable": Indicates no routing information, an incorrect default gateway, loss of local connectivity, or a routing configuration error.
    * "No Reply" / "Request timed out": The host is unavailable, cannot route a reply, packet dropped due to TTL expiry, congestion, or a firewall blocking ICMP.

### `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` / `ip` (Linux/macOS)

These commands display and sometimes configure network interface parameters.

* **`ipconfig /all` (Windows):** Lists comprehensive TCP/IP configuration details, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS servers, DHCP server, MAC address, and lease information.
* **`ifconfig` (macOS, Linux - Legacy):** Lists IP address and mask for specific interfaces or all interfaces.
    * **Note:** In modern Linux distributions, `ifconfig` is largely superseded by the `ip` command from the `iproute2` utility suite.
* **`networksetup -getinfo interface` (Mac):** Lists IP settings, including the default router.
* **`networksetup -getdnsservers interface` (Mac):** Lists DNS servers used.
* **`ip address` (Linux):** Lists IP address and mask information for interfaces; the Linux replacement for `ifconfig`. Often abbreviated as `ip a`.
    * `ip addr show` or `ip a`: Reports address configuration for all interfaces.
    * `ip addr show dev [interface_name]`: Reports information for a single interface (e.g., `ip addr show dev etho`).
    * `ip -s link show`: Displays status of interfaces and statistics.
    * `ip link set [interface_name] up/down`: Enables or disables an interface.
    * `ip addr add [ip_address]/[prefix_length] dev [interface_name]`: Used to add an IP address.
    * `ip addr del [ip_address]/[prefix_length] dev [interface_name]`: Used to delete an IP address.
    * **Note on Persistent vs. Running Config:** `ip` commands by default modify only the running configuration, which is lost on reboot unless saved to persistent configuration files (e.g., `/etc/network/interfaces` or NetworkManager/systemd-network configurations).
* **Windows DNS Cache Management:**
    * `ipconfig /displaydns`: To view the local DNS cache.
    * `ipconfig /flushdns`: To purge the local DNS cache.
    * `ipconfig /all && nslookup command`: To display Windows device DNS servers.

### `netstat`

`netstat` (Network Statistics) resolves and displays network statistics such as current network connections and port activities.

* **`netstat -a`:** Shows all listening ports and established connections.
* **`netstat -at` or `netstat -au`:** List TCP or UDP protocols respectively.
* **`netstat -l`:** List ports in "listening" mode (open and ready to accept incoming connections). Can be combined with `t` or `u` (e.g., `netstat -lt`).
* **`netstat -s`:** List network usage statistics by protocol. Can be combined with `-t` or `-u`.
* **`netstat -tp`:** List connections with the service name and PID (Process ID) information.
* **`netstat -i`:** Shows interface statistics.
* **Common Use:** `netstat -ano` (Windows)
    * `-a`: Display all sockets.
    * `-n`: Do not resolve names (displays IP addresses and port numbers numerically).
    * `-o`: Display timers (Windows specific, shows PID).
* **`netstat -rn` (Windows, Mac, Linux):** Lists the host's routing table, including a default route that uses the DHCP-learned default gateway.
    * **Note:** In modern Linux, `ip route` is the replacement for `netstat -rn`.

### `arp` / `ip neigh`

The `arp` (Address Resolution Protocol) utility is used to manage the ARP cache, which stores mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses on the local network.

* **`arp -a` (Windows, Mac, Linux):** Displays the current ARP cache contents.
* **`arp -d [IP Address]`:** Deletes a specific entry from the ARP cache.
* **`arp -d`:** Deletes all entries from the ARP cache.
* **`arp -s [IP Address] [MAC Address]`:** Adds a static entry to the ARP cache.
* **`ip neigh` (Linux - Modern):** The replacement for `arp` in Linux, for managing the neighbor table (which includes ARP entries).

### `traceroute` / `tracert`

`traceroute` (Linux/macOS/Routers) or `tracert` (Windows) determines the path (route) that packets take to reach a destination host, showing each intermediate router (hop).

* **How it works:** Sends probes with incrementally increasing TTL values.
    * TTL=1 probe: Causes the first router to respond with an ICMP Time Exceeded message.
    * TTL=2 probe: Causes the second router to respond, and so on.
    * This continues until the destination is reached, which responds (Windows `tracert` uses ICMP Echo Reply, Unix `traceroute` typically uses ICMP Port Unreachable).
* **Syntax:**
    * `traceroute <destination>` (Linux)
    * `tracert <destination>` (Windows)
* **Protocol:** By default, Windows `tracert` uses ICMP. Unix `traceroute` uses UDP. Both can be configured to use the other protocol with switches (e.g., `-I` for ICMP in Linux `traceroute`).
* **IPv6:** `traceroute -6` or `tracert -6` for IPv6 networks.
* **Output:** Shows the IP address of each hop and the RTT for multiple probes to that hop. An asterisk (`*`) indicates no response within the timeout period (e.g., router not responding, firewall blocking, packet looping).
* **Use Cases:** Isolating network bottlenecks, identifying where packets are being dropped, or mapping network paths.

### DNS Lookup Utilities (`nslookup`, `dig`, `host`)

These tools are used to query DNS servers for information about domain names.

#### `nslookup` (Name Server Look Up)

* Finds the IP address of a domain name.
* **Syntax:** `nslookup DOMAIN_NAME` or `nslookup -type=QUERY_TYPE DOMAIN_NAME SERVER`
    * `QUERY_TYPE`: (e.g., `A` for IPv4, `AAAA` for IPv6, `MX` for mail exchange, `NS` for name server).
    * `DOMAIN_NAME`: The domain you are querying.
    * `SERVER`: Optional; the specific DNS server to query (e.g., 1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8).

#### `dig` (Domain Information Groper)

* A more flexible and powerful tool for interrogating DNS name servers, providing more detailed output than `nslookup`.
* **Syntax:** `dig @server name type`
    * `@server`: The name or IP address of the DNS server to query.
    * `name`: The domain name or resource record to look up.
    * `type`: The type of query (e.g., `ANY`, `A`, `MX`, `SIG`). If omitted, defaults to `A` record.
* **Key Feature:** Displays the **TTL (Time To Live)** of the queried DNS record, indicating how long the record should be cached by clients before being re-queried.

#### `host`

* A simple utility for performing DNS lookups, primarily used to convert names to IP addresses and vice versa.
* **Syntax:** `host {name} [server]`
    * `name`: The domain name, IPv4, or IPv6 address to look up.
    * `server`: Optional; the name or IP address of the DNS server to query instead of the default.

### `whois`

* Allows you to query public databases for information about domain name registrations (registrant, registrar, nameservers, registration dates).
* **Note:** May require installation (`sudo apt install whois` on Debian-based systems).
* Queries Network Information Centers (NICs) databases, starting with IANA and following referrals to more specific servers.

## Advanced Network Analysis Tools

### Protocol Analyzers

A **Protocol Analyzer** works in conjunction with a **packet capture** or **sniffer** tool.
* **Function:** Parses each frame in a stream of traffic to reveal its header fields and payload contents in a readable format (Packet Analysis).
* **Features:**
    * **Filters:** To show only particular frames or sequences of frames.
    * **Follow TCP/UDP Stream:** Reconstructs the packet contents for a TCP/UDP session.
    * **Conversation and Statistics:** Monitor communication flows (e.g., bandwidth consumed per protocol or per host), identify active network hosts, and monitor network utilization and bottlenecks.

#### Connecting a Sniffer:

1.  **Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) / Mirror Port:** A specifically configured switch port that receives copies of frames addressed to nominated access ports.
2.  **Passive Test Access Point (TAP):** A hardware device that physically copies the signal from network cabling to a monitor port without interfering with the active link.
3.  **Active Test Access Point (TAP):** A powered device that performs signal regeneration, often used for more complex monitoring scenarios.

### `tcpdump`

`tcpdump` is a command-line packet capture utility on Linux, providing a user interface to the `libpcap` library.

* **Basic Syntax:** `tcpdump -i eth0` (captures traffic on `eth0`).
* **Filters:** Often used with filter expressions combined using Boolean Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`). Complex filters should be enclosed in quotes and can use parentheses for grouping.
    * **Example:** `sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i interfaceName` (listens specifically for ICMP traffic).
    * **Complex Filter Example:** `tcpdump -i eth0 "src host 10.0.1.100 and (dst port 53 or dst port 80)"`
* Supports Regex for searching within captured output.

### `Ncat` / `Wireshark` / `Tshark`

* **NCAT (Netcat Tool):** A versatile network utility used for reading from and writing to network connections. Can be used to copy network traffic across devices for analysis.
* **Wireshark:** An open-source graphical packet capture, filter, and analysis utility.
    * **Interface:** Displays output in a 3-pane view:
        * Upper pane: Each captured frame.
        * Middle pane: Decoded fields of the currently selected frame.
        * Bottom pane: Raw data in Hex and ASCII.
* **Tshark:** The command-line version of Wireshark.

### NetFlow (and IPFIX)

**NetFlow** gathers **metadata only** (summarized traffic information, not the full packet payload) and reports it to a structured database. It can also use sampling to further reduce processing demands. NetFlow has been redeveloped as the **IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)** IETF standard.

**Components of a NetFlow deployment:**

1.  **NetFlow Exporter:** Configured on network appliances (switches, routers, firewalls).
    * A **traffic flow** is defined by packets that share the same characteristics (e.g., source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol – often called a **5-tuple**). A **7-tuple** flow adds the input interface and IP Type of Service.
    * The Exporter caches data for newly seen flows and transmits the data to a collector when the flow expires (e.g., after a period of inactivity or reaching a size limit).
2.  **NetFlow Collector:** Aggregates flows from multiple exporters. Requires high-bandwidth network links and substantial storage capacity. Must support compatible NetFlow versions (most widely deployed are v5 and v9) or IPFIX.
3.  **NetFlow Analyzer:** Reports and interprets information by querying the collector. Can be configured to generate alerts and notifications. In practical terms, the Collector and Analyzer are often integrated into one solution.

**Use Cases:** Network monitoring, security analysis, billing, traffic engineering, and capacity planning.

## Chapter 17: Network Troubleshooting Methodology

Effective network troubleshooting requires a systematic approach to problem-solving and clear communication with users/clients. The following best practice model provides a proven process:

### 1. Identify the Problem

This initial phase is about gathering as much information as possible to understand the issue.

* **Gather Information:**
    * **Scope:** Determine the scope of the problem (e.g., single user affected, multiple users/group, specific workstation, entire network segment). This helps identify the source and prioritize the issue.
    * **Symptoms:** Identify facts and clues in the affected system. Symptoms can be correlated with known cases and issues. Issues that are difficult to reproduce are often the hardest to troubleshoot.
    * **Duplicate the Problem (If Possible):** This is crucial for understanding the exact conditions under which the problem occurs and for later testing your solution.
* **Question Users:**
    * Use **Open Questions** to encourage users to explain the problem in their own words (e.g., "Describe what happened when you tried to access the network.").
    * Use **Closed Questions** to get explicit Yes/No or fixed responses (e.g., "Is the power light on the router green?").
* **Determine if Anything Has Changed:** This is often the most critical question.
    * "Did it ever work?"
    * "What has changed since it last worked?" (e.g., new software, hardware, configuration change, user activity).
* **Approach Multiple Problems Individually:** If problems are not related, treat each issue as a separate case, advising the user to initiate a separate support request. However, if they seem related, check for outstanding support or maintenance tickets that might indicate existing problems.

### 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause

Based on the information gathered, formulate hypotheses about what might be causing the problem.

* **Question the Obvious:** Start with the simplest and most common potential points of failure.
* **Consider Multiple Approaches:** If one approach doesn't identify the problem, use a different one.
* **OSI Model Approach (Methodical Validation):**
    * **Top-to-Bottom / Bottom-to-Top:** Test or prove the functionality of each component at each layer of the OSI model in sequence, starting from either the top (Application layer) or bottom (Physical layer). Only move up/down when you have discounted a layer as the source of the problem.
    * **Divide and Conquer:** Rather than starting strictly at the top or bottom, begin with the layer most likely to be causing the problem (based on symptoms and scope) and then work either up or down depending on your tests' revelations. This is generally the most efficient for experienced troubleshooters.

### 3. Test the Theory to Determine Cause

Put your hypothesis to the test using diagnostic tools and techniques.

* **Confirm Theory:** If your test confirms the theory, you can proceed to determine the steps to solve the problem.
* **Re-establish New Theory / Escalate:** If the theory is not confirmed, re-evaluate the symptoms, gather more information, and establish a new theory. If you've exhausted your theories or expertise, **escalate** the problem. Escalation means referring the problem to a senior technician, specialized technical staff (developers, programmers), third-party vendors/suppliers, or service carriers/contractors.

### 4. Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Identify Potential Effects

Once the cause is confirmed, plan the solution.

* An action plan sets out the specific steps you will take to solve the problem (e.g., repair, replace, upgrade, reconfigure).
* **Test by Substitution:** A basic but effective technique when troubleshooting devices by having a known good duplicate on hand.
* **Assess Cost and Time:** Consider the cost and time required for the solution, as well as its potential disruptive effects on the rest of the system or users. Plan for minimal disruption.

### 5. Implement the Solution or Escalate as Necessary

Execute your action plan.

* **Authorization:** If you don't have authorization to implement a solution (e.g., requiring system downtime, significant configuration changes), escalate to a senior staff member for approval.
* **Scheduling:** If applying the solution is disruptive to the wider network, consider the most appropriate time to schedule the reconfiguration work (e.g., off-hours) and plan how to notify users/clients.

### 6. Verify Full System Functionality and Implement Preventive Measures

After implementing the solution, thoroughly check that the problem is fixed and that no new issues have been introduced.

* **Validate the Fix:** Confirm that the solution addresses the reported problem.
* **Verify Overall Functionality:** Ensure the system as a whole continues to function normally. Identify the effects/results of the solution.
* **Preventive Measures:** To fully solve a problem, you should try to eliminate any factors that may cause the problem to recur or persist by implementing preventive measures (e.g., documentation, training, process changes, hardware upgrades, monitoring).

### 7. Document Your Findings, Actions, and Outcomes

Documentation is crucial for knowledge management and future troubleshooting.

* **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write clearly, concisely, and free from grammatical/spelling errors.
* **Ticket System:** Most troubleshooting takes place within the context of a ticket system. This is immensely useful for future troubleshooting, as problems fitting into the same category can be reviewed to see if the same solution applies.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues that Affect Cabled Network Connectivity

#### Network Performance Characteristics

* **Speed:** Often used broadly to describe how well a link is performing.
* **Band Rate (Baud):** Measured in Hertz (Hz), this is the number of symbols that can be transmitted per second. A symbol is a series of events that make up signals (e.g., a pulse of higher voltage, or the transition between peak and trough in electrical signals). Encoding schemes ensure the bit rate will be higher than the baud rate. (Physical Layer)
* **Bandwidth:** The theoretical maximum amount of information that can be transmitted, measured in bits per second (bps). (Data Link Layer)
* **Throughput:** The actual average data transfer rate achieved over a period of time. This excludes encoding schemes, errors, and losses incurred at the physical and data link layers, and is affected by link distance and interference. Throughput is often referred to as **packet loss** when measured at the Network (Layer 3) and Transport (Layer 4) layers.
* **Latency / Delay:** The speed at which packets are delivered, measured in units of time (typically milliseconds, ms). Latency can occur at many layers of the OSI model.

#### Signal Issues

* **Attenuation:** Loss of signal strength (expressed in decibels, dB). Measured as the ratio between signal strength at the origin/source versus at the destination.
    * A logarithmic scale (dB) is used due to its non-linear function; a small change in dB value represents a large change in measured performance.
    * `+3dB` means doubling, `-3dB` means halving; `+6dB` means quadrupling, `-6dB` means quartering.
    * The maximum allowed value for insertion loss depends on the cable category and standard. Smaller values are better (less loss).
    * Solutions for high attenuation: Use higher grade or shielded cable, find a shorter cable run, or install a repeater/additional switch.
* **Noise:** Anything that is transmitted within or close to the channel that isn't the intended signal. Expressed in **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**. Noise makes the signal itself difficult to distinguish, causing errors in data and leading to retransmissions.
    * A high SNR value means the signal strength is significantly greater than the noise present. A result closer to 0 dB indicates the link is subject to high error rates.
    * **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):** Noise that should ideally be detected when the cable is installed. If it appears later, suspect a new source or a source not accounted for during initial testing.
    * **Radio Frequency Interference (RFI):** EMI that occurs in frequencies used for radio transmissions.
    * **Crosstalk:** Interference from nearby cables (also measured in dB). Usually indicates problems with bad wiring, poor quality cables, improper cable type for the application, or bad connectors/improper termination.

        * **NEXT (Near End Crosstalk):** Measures crosstalk on the receive pairs at the transmitter end.
        * **ACR-N (Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Near End):** Difference between Insertion Loss and NEXT.
        * **ACR-F (Attenuation to Crosstalk Ratio, Far End):** Difference between Insertion Loss and FEXT (Far End Crosstalk).
        * **Power Sum (PSNEXT, PSACR-N, PSACR-F):** Combine crosstalk from multiple pairs.
* **Loss of Connectivity:**
    * **Complete Loss:** Indicates a break in the cable or faulty installation.
    * **Intermittent Loss:** Often indicates degradation from attenuation or crosstalk.

#### Cabling Issues (Physical Layer)

A typical Ethernet link for an office workstation includes:

1.  Network Transceiver in the host (end system)
2.  Patch cable between host and a wall port
3.  Structured cable between the wall port and a patch panel (permanent link)
4.  Patch cable between the patch panel and a switch port
5.  Network Transceiver in the switch port (intermediate system)

* **Network Loopback Adapter:** A specially wired RJ-45 plug with a stub of cable, used to test for bad ports and network cards. Wiring: pin 1 (Tx) to pin 3 (Rx) and pin 2 (Rx) to pin 6 (Tx), meaning packets sent by the NIC are received by itself.

* **LED Status Light Indicators (Link Lights):** On the Host NIC and Switch/Router ports.
    * **Solid Green:** Link is connected, but no traffic.
    * **Flickering Green:** Link is operating normally (with traffic). Blink rate often represents the speed.
    * **No Light:** The link is not working, or the port is shut down.
    * **Blinking Amber:** A fault has been detected (e.g., duplex mismatch, excessive collisions).
    * **Solid Amber:** The port is blocked by the Spanning Tree Algorithm (STP) to prevent loops within the domain.

* **Verifying Port Settings (Auto-negotiation, Speed, Duplex):**
    * Most NIC adapters and switches use **Auto-Negotiation** for port settings. If this process fails, the adapter and port can end up with mismatched speed or duplex settings, often because one end was manually configured. Setting both to auto-negotiate generally resolves this.
    * A **Speed Mismatch** will cause a **link failure** (no connectivity).
    * A **Duplex Mismatch** will slow the link down considerably, causing high packet loss and late collisions (often seen as blinking amber on Cisco switches for duplex mismatch detection).

* **Cable Installation and Types:**
    * Ensure the cable grade is appropriate for the application (e.g., Cat 6 for Gigabit Ethernet).
    * Ensure the cable jacket is suitable for the installation location: **Plenum-rated cable** in plenum spaces (for fire safety), **Riser-rated cable** in riser spaces.
    * The best time to verify wiring installation and termination is immediately after connections are made, while cable runs are still accessible.

* **Cable Testers:** Report detailed information on the physical and electrical properties of a cable.
    * They test and report on cable conditions, crosstalk, attenuation, noise, and resistance.
    * **Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR):** Often incorporated into advanced cable testers. A TDR measures the length of a cable run and locates breaks, shorts, kinks, sharp bends, and other imperfections affecting performance. It transmits a short signal pulse and measures the amplitude and time delay of reflections to determine distance to a fault (often within a meter).
    * **Multimeter:** For testing electrical circuits, can test continuity of copper wire, existence of a short, and integrity of a terminator.
    * **Wire Map Tester:** Multimeters designed for computer networks can incorporate this function to identify wiring problems.

* **Wiring Problems (Pin-out / Termination Issues):**
    * **Continuity (Open):** A conductor does not form a closed circuit (a break in the wire).
    * **Shorts:** Two conductors are joined at some point due to insulating wire damage.
    * **Incorrect Pin-out / Termination / Mismatched Cable Standards:** Conductors are incorrectly wired into the terminals.
        * **Reversed Pair:** Conductors in a pair have been wired to different terminals (e.g., pin 1 and 2 are swapped).
        * **Crossed Pair (Tx/Rx Reverse):** The conductors from one pair have been connected to pins belonging to a different pair (e.g., Tx pair connected to Rx pair pins).
        * **Split Pair:** Both ends of a single wire in one pair are wired to different pairs. Split pairs can only be measured by a cable tester that measures crosstalk.

* **Network Tone Generator / Probe (Fox and Hound):** Used to trace a cable from end to end, which is necessary when cables are bundled and not properly labeled.

#### Fibre-Optic Cable Testing Issues

While fiber optic cables do not suffer from attenuation to the same extent as copper, there is still some signal loss due to microscopic imperfections in the glass fiber core or its edges, causing light to scatter or be absorbed.

* **Attenuation:** EIA/TIA 568 specification allows for signal loss between `0.5 dB/km` to `3.5 dB/km`, depending on fiber type and wavelength.
    * Tested using an **Optical Power Meter** and **Optical Light Source**.
* **Cable Break:** Located using an **Optical Time Domain Reflectometer (OTDR)**, which can also verify the soundness of new splices and connections.
* **Optical Spectrum Analyzer (OSA):** Typically used with Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) to ensure each channel has sufficient power, especially over long distances where attenuation of different wavelengths can vary (Spectral Attenuation).
* **Common Fibre Issues:**
    * **Dirty Optical Connectors:** Dirt, dust, or grease in the transmission path will greatly reduce signal strength or completely block transmission.
    * **Incorrect Transceivers:** Using mismatched transceivers (e.g., SFP, GBIC, media converters) at each optical interface. They must match for complete transmission, as they are designed for specific fiber types. For example, transceivers for single-mode fiber use lasers, while multi-mode fiber transceivers typically use LEDs (infrared light).
    * **Mismatch between Cable, Patch Cords, and Interfaces:** Can lead to significant signal loss.

#### Troubleshooting Common Network Layer and Application Layer Issues

#### DNS Issues (Can't Ping by Hostname)

* **DNS (Domain Name System):** Maps names to IP addresses. Many services use hostnames and domain names for ease of reconfiguration and user access. Name resolution is central to network functionality.
* **Common Problem:** Incorrect DNS server configuration. Most hosts are configured with primary and secondary DNS servers for redundancy, typically via DHCP.
    * **Windows:** `ipconfig /all`
    * **Linux:** `/etc/resolv.conf`
* **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    * Check that the correct DNS server addresses are configured.
    * Attempt to `ping` the DNS servers by their IP addresses to check connectivity between the host and its DNS servers. If you can ping the IP but not resolve names, the issue is likely DNS-related.

#### Multicast Flowing Issues

* **Multicast:** A "one-to-many" transmission designed for more efficient delivery of packets. Instead of a transmitter sending separate unicast packets to each receiver, a copy of the same packet is delivered to each receiver that has joined the relevant multicast group.
* **IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol):** Used to establish multicast groups at Layer 3.
* **Problem:** If a switch is not "multicast-aware" (i.e., **IGMP Snooping** is not enabled), it will treat multicast transmissions as broadcasts and flood them across all ports in the broadcast domain. This consumes excessive bandwidth and slows down the network, especially if multicast traffic is flooded to VLANs that do not need to receive it.
* **Solution: IGMP Snooping:**
    * Enabling IGMP Snooping (globally on a switch and as a per-VLAN option) allows the switch to read IGMP messages.
    * The switch can then determine which hosts on an access port or within a VLAN have joined a multicast group, thereby filtering multicast traffic only to ports participating in the multicast group.

#### Intermittent Connectivity Issues (Often Complex)

It's wise to rule out physical hardware failures and data link layer issues before diagnosing network layer or service issues. Intermittent problems are often the most challenging.

* **Common Causes:**
    * Power failures (blackouts) or power loss (brownouts) - consider **Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)**.
    * Hardware failure (host adapters, switches, routers, intermediary devices).
    * Cabling issues (e.g., damaged cable, loose connection).
    * Overheating of network devices.
* **Initial Steps:**
    * Use loopback testers and cable certifiers to rule out physical cable and port issues.
    * Often, restarting network devices can clear temporary errors.

#### Interface Status Issues

* If you isolate the issue to a single host and rule out cable/transceiver issues at the physical layer, the data link configuration might not be working.
* **Check LED Status Indicators:** (Connection UP/DOWN, Link Status).
* **Switch Command Line Utility:**
    * Check interface status (e.g., `show interfaces`).
    * Verify auto-negotiation, speed, and duplex settings are correctly configured.
    * Ensure the protocol status is "up." If the speed is mismatched between the host and switch port, the link will fail.
    * Check for faulty host NIC (Network Interface Card).

#### IP Configuration Issues

* Once physical and data link layers are ruled out, check basic IP addressing and protocol configurations.
* **Verify Host Configuration (`ipconfig` / `ifconfig` / `ip addr`):**
    * **Incorrect IP Address:** Each end system must have an IP address that produces a valid, unique host address within its subnet. Remember that the network address and broadcast address cannot be used for hosts.
    * **Incorrect Subnet Mask:** If a netmask is incorrect, the host might receive communications but misroute its replies, assuming the communicating hosts are on a different subnet. If the mask is shorter than it should be (e.g., `/24` instead of `/26`), it might cause packets to go via a router, placing unnecessary load on it.

### Routing Issues

* **Missing Route:** May arise because a required static routing entry has not been entered or was entered incorrectly, or due to a router's failure to communicate with its neighbors and thus not receiving routing protocol updates.
* **Troubleshooting Steps:**
    1.  **Ping Host's Default Gateway:** If you can ping a host's default gateway but cannot ping some/all hosts on remote networks, suspect a routing issue.
    2.  **Offline Router:** A router might have gone offline with no alternative path to the destination network. Be prepared for configuration issues.
    3.  **`traceroute` / `tracert`:** Utilize these commands to identify where the network path fails.
    4.  **Inspect Routing Tables (`show ip route` / `show route`):** Use these commands to confirm the presence of specific IP network routes.
    5.  **Identify Missing Route:** Due to incorrect static routing entries or communication failure.
    6.  **Device Config Review:** Ensure the device's running configuration matches the documented baseline.
    7.  **Ping Neighbor Router Nodes:** Verify basic connectivity between routers.
    8.  **Examine Routing Protocol Configuration:** If there is a network path and neighbors, focus on potential authentication issues or incorrect parameters in routing protocol configurations.

#### Routing Loops

* A **Routing Loop** occurs when two or more routers use one another as the path to a network. Packets caught in a routing loop circle around the routers until their TTL (Time-To-Live) expires.
* **Symptom:** Routers generating many ICMP Time Exceeded error messages.
* **Diagnosis (`traceroute`):** You can use `traceroute` to diagnose a routing loop by looking for IP addresses that appear multiple times in the output, as packets will traverse such routes more than once until TTL expires.
* **Prevention (Distance Vector Protocols):**
    1.  **Maximum Hop Count:** If the cost exceeds a certain value (e.g., 16 in RIP, 255 in EIGRP), the network is deemed unreachable ("poison route" advertised with a hop count of 16).
    2.  **Hold-down Timer:** If a node declares a network unreachable, its neighbors start a hold-down timer. Any updates received about that route from other nodes are discarded for the duration of the timer, ensuring all nodes have converged information about an unreachable network.
    3.  **Split Horizon:** Prevents a routing update from being copied back to the source interface from which it was learned.
* **Link-State Protocols:** Use timely updates and flood a consistent topology database to all nodes in the routing domain, ensuring each node has a consistent view of the network. A loop here indicates that timely updates are not propagated correctly.

#### Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Routing

* **Symmetrical Routing:** The return path of a route equals the forward path.
* **Asymmetrical Routing:** The return path of a route is different from the forward path.
    * **Problematic When:**
        * The return path has significantly higher latency/delay than the forward path.
        * Different paths cause stateful firewalls or NAT devices to filter or drop packet communication. This is common where load balancers or multiple redundant paths across the Internet are involved.
    * Such devices (stateful firewalls/NAT) should not be placed in the middle of a network where forward and return paths could diverge.

### Switching Loops

* A **Switching Loop** is where flooded frames circulate the network perpetually without intervention, causing a **Broadcast Storm**.
* **How it Happens:** Switches flood broadcasts (e.g., ARP, DHCP requests) out to all ports. If there's a loop (redundant link without proper control), these frames will go down one link to the next switch, which will send the broadcast back up the redundant link to the originating switch. As this repeats, switches start to see source MAC addresses associated with multiple ports, causing them to constantly clear their MAC address tables (MAC address flapping), which then causes them to flood unicast traffic as well (because they don't know where the MAC is).
* **Impact:** A broadcast storm can quickly consume all link bandwidth, crashing the network and connected appliances.
* **Prevention: Spanning Tree Protocol (STP):** STP detects loops and designates one port as a "blocking port" to prevent the loop, isolating the problem to a segment of the network.
* **Troubleshooting a Loop:**
    * Inspect physical ports that correspond to disabled interfaces for looped connections.
    * Check the switch log events related to MAC address flapping.
    * If a broadcast storm occurs on a network where STP is already enabled, investigate:
        * Verify compatible versions of STP are enabled on all switches.
        * Verify the physical configuration of segments that use legacy equipment (e.g., older Ethernet hubs).
        * Investigate network devices in the user environment (e.g., unmanaged desktop switches) and verify that they are not connected as part of a loop.
* Switching loops can be physical cabling issues or configuration interface issues.
* **Managed vs. Unmanaged Switches:** Unmanaged switches are basic plug-and-play devices with no configuration needed, offering less flexibility. Managed switches offer more control and can be customized (e.g., for creating VLANs, enabling STP).

### Network Visibility and Diagnostic Tools

* **Purpose:** To verify exactly what is connected to the network and what is being communicated over it. Necessary to confirm that servers and clients are in the correct VLAN/subnet and to identify unauthorized machines ("rogue hosts").
* **IP Scanners:** Tools that perform host discovery (determine if an IP address is "up") and can establish the overall topology of the network in terms of subnets and routers.
    * Often integrated with **IP Address Management (IPAM)** suites (combining DHCP, DNS, and IPAM, e.g., Windows Server, BlueCat, Infoblox, SolarWinds IPAM).
    * Some use SNMP queries for detailed network statistics.
    * Some are optimized for quick discovery of legitimate hosts; others are security-oriented for identifying hidden rogue hosts.
    * **Basic Tools:** `ping`, `arp`, `traceroute`.
    * **Advanced Tools:** `Nmap` (including `Zenmap` GUI) for host discovery, auditing, and penetration testing.

* **`netstat` Command (Network Statistics):** Allows you to check the state of ports on the "localhost."
    * Used to identify service misconfigurations, determine which services are running on which ports, and identify suspicious remote connections to services on the localhost.
    * **Common Switches:**
        * `-s`: Show TCP connections.
        * `-u`: Show UDP connections.
        * `-w`: Show raw sockets.
        * `-a`: Display all open ports, active ports, and listening ports.
        * `-l`: Display listening ports only.
        * `-n`: Display in numerical format (no name resolution).
        * `-4` or `-6`: Filter sockets by IPv4 or IPv6.
        * **Windows Specific:**
            * `-o`: Shows the Process ID (PID) that opened that port.
            * `-b`: Shows the process name.
        * **Linux Specific:**
            * `-p`: Shows PID and process name.
            * `-i`: Ethernet statistics.
            * `-r`: Routing table display. (Note: In Linux, `netstat` is deprecated in favor of `iproute2` commands like `ip link`, `ip addr`, `ss` for sockets, and `ip route`).
            * `-N`: Suppress name resolution.

* **Packet Analyzers (`tcpdump`, Wireshark, TShark):** Crucial for verifying exactly what traffic is on the wire, inspecting headers, and understanding communication flows. (Refer to previous notes on Protocol Analyzers).

## Interface Monitoring Metrics

Collecting data and configuring alerts for interface system metrics is crucial for proactive network management and troubleshooting.

**Key Interface Metrics:**

* **Link State:** Measures whether an interface is working (up) or not (down). This is the most basic connectivity check.
* **Resets:** The number of times an interface has restarted over a given period. Anything more than occasional resets should be closely monitored and investigated. An interface that continuously resets is described as **flapping**.
* **Speed:** The rated speed of an interface (e.g., Mbps, Gbps). For Ethernet links, the interface speed should match on both the host and switch ports. A speed mismatch will result in a link failure.
* **Duplex:** Most modern Ethernet interfaces operate in full-duplex mode. Operating in half-duplex mode requires investigation unless you are intentionally supporting legacy devices. A duplex mismatch will cause severe performance issues (high packet loss, late collisions).
* **Utilization:** The amount of data traffic (both sent and received) transferred over a period.
    * Calculated as a percentage of bandwidth.
    * Differentiate between **Average Utilization** and **Peak Utilization**. If average utilization is 80%, there might seem to be sufficient bandwidth, but if peak utilization spikes to 100%, this will manifest as delay and packet loss, indicating a need for an upgrade.
* **Per-Protocol Utilization:** Packet or byte counts for a specific protocol over a period. High packet counts for certain protocols can increase processing load on CPU and memory resources.
* **Error Rate:** The number of packets per second that cause errors. In general, error rates should be less than 1%. High error rates often indicate a driver problem, interference, or a poor quality link/cable.
* **Discards/Drops:** An interface may discard incoming or outgoing frames for several reasons, including:
    * Checksum errors.
    * Mismatched MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit).
    * Packets too small (runt) or too large (giant, jumbo frame mismatch).
    * High load/congestion.
    * Permissions (e.g., Interface Access Control List - ACL).
    * VLAN configuration problems.
    * Each interface is likely to categorize and type discards separately to assist with troubleshooting.
* **Retransmissions:** If you observe high levels of retransmissions (especially in TCP-based traffic), you must analyze and troubleshoot the specific cause of the underlying packet loss, errors, discards, or drops. This could involve multiple aspects of network configuration and connectivity.

### Troubleshooting Interface Errors

Interface errors often indicate a misconfiguration problem at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) or Layer 1 (Physical Layer).

1.  **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) Errors:**
    * A CRC is calculated by an interface when it sends a frame.
    * CRC errors are usually caused by interference due to poor quality cable or termination, attenuation, or mismatches of transceivers (SFPs) and cable types. These are typically Layer 1 issues.
2.  **Encapsulation Errors:**
    * Encapsulation refers to the frame format expected on the interface.
    * These errors prevent retransmission or reception. The physical link status will be "up," but the line protocol will be listed as "down."
    * Common causes include:
        * Incorrect Ethernet frame type.
        * Incorrect VLAN tagging (e.g., missing or wrong `802.1Q` tag).
        * WAN framing issues (e.g., PPP, Frame Relay configuration mismatch).
3.  **Runt Frame Errors:**
    * A runt frame is a frame that is smaller than the minimum 64-byte size for Ethernet frame format.
    * Usually caused by a **collision**.
    * In a switched environment, collisions should only be expected on an interface connected to a legacy hub device or if there is a duplex mismatch in the interface configuration.
    * If runt frames are generated in other conditions, suspect a driver issue on the transmitting host.
4.  **Giant Frame Errors:**
    * A giant frame is a frame that is larger than the maximum permissible MTU size (1518 bytes for Ethernet II, including preamble and Frame Check Sequence).
    * Two likely causes:
        * **Ethernet Trunks:** If one switch is configured for `802.1Q` (VLAN tagging) framing but the other is not, frames will appear too large to the receiver, as `802.1Q` adds 4 bytes to the header, making the max frame size 1522 bytes, which might not tally with the other end's expectation.
        * **Jumbo Frames Mismatch:** A host might be configured to use jumbo frames (typically up to 9000 bytes), but the switch interface is not configured to receive them. This type of issue often occurs when configuring Storage Area Network (SAN) links between SAN devices and data networks.

### Troubleshooting Service and Security Issues in the Application Layer

#### 1. DHCP Issues

If a client fails to obtain a DHCP lease, it defaults to using an **APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing)** address in the `169.254.0.0/16` range. Such a client will be limited to communication only with other APIPA hosts on the same network segment (broadcast domain).

**Possible Reasons for a Host to Fail to Obtain a DHCP Lease:**

* **DHCP Server is Offline:** Users will continue to connect to the network for a short period (until their existing lease expires), but will then start to lose contact with network services and servers as they try to renew their lease.
* **DHCP Scope / Port Exhaustion:** No more available addresses due to a high lease duration or a large number of devices.
* **Router Doesn't Support BOOTP Forwarding / DHCP Relays:** If the DHCP server is on a different subnet/VLAN than the client, the router between them must be configured to forward DHCP (BOOTP) requests.
    * **Solution:** Install RFC-1542 compliant routers or add another type of DHCP Relay agent to each subnet or VLAN.
* **Reconfiguration Issues:** During reconfiguration of DHCP servers and scopes, ensure to **lower the lease duration in advance** of changes. This forces all clients to renew their leases more frequently, mitigating the risk of expired IP, default gateway, or DNS server addresses not being updated when changes are applied.

#### Rogue DHCP Server Issues

A **Rogue DHCP Server** may be deployed accidentally (e.g., forgetting to disable a DHCP server in an access point/router) or by a malicious attacker to subvert the network.

* Since hosts have no means of preferring a DHCP server, clients could end up with an incorrect IP configuration because they obtained a lease from a rogue DHCP server.
* An attacker would normally use a rogue server to change the default gateway and/or DNS resolver addresses for the subnet, routing communications via their machine (an on-path attack).

#### 2. Name Resolution Issues

To troubleshoot name resolution, you should establish the different ways a host can use to resolve a hostname/FQDN to an IP address. In general, the following methods are tried in order:

a.  **Check Local Cache:** Individual applications (e.g., web browsers) and the operating system maintain their own caches of resolved names. Clear these caches for troubleshooting.
b.  **Check HOSTS File:** The `hosts` file (`%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows) is a static list of hostname-to-IP address mappings. In most cases, the `hosts` file should not contain any entries other than the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`). Any static entries here could be the cause of a name resolution issue.
c.  **Query DNS Servers:** A host uses the name servers defined in its IP configuration to resolve queries.
    * Modified forms of DNS allow clients to perform name resolution on a local link without needing a server, such as **Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR)** and **Multicast DNS (mDNS)**.

**DNS Configuration Issues:**

* Reconfiguration of DNS records should be planned and implemented carefully to avoid caching problems.
* In the absence of DNS servers, network clients will be unable to log on or connect to services or servers by name.
* **Troubleshooting Symptoms:**
    * **Ability to connect to a server by IP address but not by name:** This strongly suggests a name resolution problem. To verify, you can temporarily edit the `hosts` file on the client and place the correct name-to-IP address record for the target host. If it then works, the issue is DNS.
    * **If a single client is unable to resolve names:** The issue is likely with the client's current configuration.
        * Client has been configured with no DNS server address or an incorrect DNS address.
        * Client has an incorrect DNS suffix. Verify the DNS domain in which the client is supposed to be and verify the host's configuration matches.
    * **DHCP Impact:** Bear in mind that in both of these situations, DHCP might be configuring these settings incorrectly (address and suffix). Therefore, verify and check the server and scope options configuration on the DHCP server as well.
    * **If multiple clients are affected:** The issue is likely to lie with the DNS server service itself, or the way a subnet accesses the DNS server service. Check that the DNS server is online and available (e.g., `ping` the resolver from affected clients).

#### 3. Untrusted Certificate Issues

The most common reason for a certificate not to be trusted is that the **Certificate Authority (CA) issuer is not trusted**.

* If you trust a web server's CA issuer, you can add their certificate to the client's Root Certificate store.
    * **Windows:** Use `certmgr.msc` console to manage user certificates and `certlm.msc` console to manage machine certificates (certificates used by the computer or its user accounts).
* **Complication:** Different applications (e.g., web browsers, email clients) may have different stores of trusted certificates.
* **Other Causes of Untrusted Certificates:**
    1.  **Certificate Subject Name Does Not Match URL:** The certificate's common name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) does not match the URL/hostname being accessed. Confirm the certificate common name and access the website by using that exact URL. This can also happen if a host is being accessed via an IP address instead of its hostname.
    2.  **Certificate Not Being Used for Its Stated Purpose:** For example, a certificate intended for signing email is being used on a web server. In such a case, do not add an exception. The service owner or subject should obtain a correctly formatted certificate.
    3.  **Certificate is Expired or Revoked:** Do not allow an exception unless you explicitly know and trust the situation.
    4.  **Time is Not Correctly Synchronized between Server and Client:** This is a common cause of certificate validation failures.

#### 4. NTP Issues (Network Time Protocol)

Most network services, especially authentication and authorization mechanisms, depend upon each host using a synchronized time source. Inaccurate time sources can:

* Affect the reliability and usability of log data, which can have implications for regulatory compliance.
* Cause certificate validation failures (as noted above).
* Lead to issues with Kerberos authentication, which has strict time synchronization requirements.

Clients must be able to access a time source over **UDP port 123**.
* **Windows:** The `w32tm /query /configuration` command can be used to check the current time synchronization configuration.

#### 5. VLAN Assignment Issues

Each VLAN is a discrete broadcast domain.

* **Service Availability:** Ensure services (e.g., DHCP, DNS) are available to all VLANs; otherwise, clients will be unable to access the Internet, for example, if there is no local DNS server available to handle their name resolutions.
* **Inter-VLAN Communication:** For devices in separate VLANs that wish to communicate, ensure proper routing has been configured and enabled (e.g., Router-on-a-Stick, Layer 3 switch with SVIs). Enable DHCP Relay to allow hosts to contact a DHCP server not in the same VLAN.
* **Incorrect VLAN Assignment:** A common issue is a host being placed in an incorrect VLAN as per its configuration baseline. This means its IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers do not match the expected VLAN assignment to the interface configuration for switch ports (if done manually).
* **Automatic VLAN Assignment Failures:** VLAN assignments configured automatically (e.g., using MAC addresses or authentication credentials) might have failed, or the database used to map the dynamic data to a VLAN ID might be misconfigured.

#### 6. Unresponsive Service and Network Performance Issues

If you can rule out connectivity problems with a local client or subnet, the issue may be with an application server rather than the client. Unresponsive service issues usually manifest with multiple clients being unable to connect.

**Underlying Causes to Consider:**

* **Application/OS Crash:** The application or operating system hosting the service has crashed.
* **Server Overload:** The server hosting the service is overloaded (e.g., high CPU, memory, or disk I/O utilization, insufficient disk space).
* **Network Congestion:** Congestion in the network, either at the client or server end. Use `ping` or `traceroute` to check the latency experienced over the network path and compare it to a network performance baseline.
* **Broadcast Storm:** A broadcast storm is causing a loss of network bandwidth. As this consumes all link bandwidth and can crash network appliances, check for excessive CPU utilization on switches and and hosts (symptom of a storm).
* **DDoS Attack:** Network congestion may also be a sign that the server service is being subjected to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Look for unusual access patterns (e.g., use GeoIP to graph source IP addresses by country and compare to baseline access patterns).
* **External Service Issue:** Use external tools (e.g., "is it down right now.com") to test whether a LAN/external Internet service connection issue is local to your network or a problem with the service provider's site.
* **Proactive Monitoring:** Be proactive in monitoring service availability to resolve problems before they significantly affect clients.

#### 7. Misconfigured Firewall and ACL Issues

* **Blocked Traffic:** Firewall, ACL, or content filter misconfigurations can cause legitimate service ports or addresses to be blocked.
* **Diagnosis:** A "deny" type of error is usually easy to identify, as users will report incidents related to the failure of specific data traffic.
    * **Confirmation:** Try to establish the connection from both inside and outside the firewall. If a connection is established outside the firewall but not from inside, this confirms the firewall as the cause.
* **Host-based vs. Network-based Firewalls:** Another potential issue is when there are both network-based (e.g., dedicated firewall appliance) and host-based (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) firewall settings to navigate in the communication path.
    * **Diagnosis:** To diagnose an issue with a host firewall, attempt the connection with it temporarily disabled. If the connection succeeds, then the network-based firewall/ACL is allowing packets, but the host-based firewall is configured to block them. If the connection still fails, investigate the network firewall/ACL first.
* **Firewall Logs:** Always inspect firewall log files to discover what rules have been applied to block traffic at a particular time.

#### 8. BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Issues

**BYOD** is a smartphone/tablet provisioning model that allows users to select a personal device to interact with corporate network services and cloud applications. Allowing user selection of devices introduces numerous compatibility, support, and security challenges.

* **Mitigation:** The impact of these issues can be mitigated through the use of **Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)** suites and **Corporate Workspaces**.
    * **EMM:** A type of network access control solution that registers devices as they connect to the network and enforces security policies thereafter.
    * **Corporate Workspace:** An application that is segmented from the rest of the device, allowing more centralized control over corporate data.
* **User Policies:** Users must also agree to acceptable use policies, prohibiting them from installing non-store apps, rooting/jailbreaking a device, and requiring them to keep the device up-to-date with patches. Users may also have to submit to inspection of the device to protect corporate data.

#### 9. Licensed Feature Issues

Licensing for servers and network appliances can be complex, and it's easy to make errors.

* Security and other features may have been configured under a trial or evaluation period and suddenly stop working when that grace period ends.
* **Troubleshooting:** The device's log (or beacon port) should be the starting point for troubleshooting. This should show whether an evaluation/trial period has just expired or when an instance count for a software has been exceeded.
* **Verification:**
    1.  Verify that the appliance has the correct licenses or activation keys installed.
    2.  If relevant, ensure that the appliance can connect to its licensing/activation server.

## Chapter 18: Wireless Standard & Wireless Security

## Wireless LANs (WLANs) based on IEEE 802.11 Standard (Wi-Fi)

Wireless connectivity is a core feature of most network environments today, primarily because it supports users' need for mobility across various devices. The IEEE 802.11 standard defines the physical layer media by which data is encoded into a radio wave signal using various **modulation schemes**. Modulation changes one or more wave properties to encode a signal. Wi-Fi still uses different carrier methods to provide sufficient resistance to interference from noise and other radio sources.

### Wireless Access and Collision Avoidance

A wireless transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) operating within a particular range of frequencies with the same modulation scheme constitute a **half-duplex shared access medium**. Unlike wired Ethernet, which uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection), Wi-Fi uses **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance)** and a virtual carrier sense flow control mechanism to cope with contention and reduce the incidence of collisions.

Rather than detecting collisions after they occur, a wireless station indicates its intent to transmit by broadcasting a **Request to Send (RTS)** signal.

1.  A station (host) broadcasts an **RTS** frame, containing the source, destination, and the time required for transmission.
2.  The receiving station (Access Point - AP) responds with a **Clear to Send (CTS)** signal.
3.  Upon receiving the CTS, the sending station transmits its data. All other stations in range that hear either the RTS or CTS signal do not attempt to transmit within that period, thereby avoiding collisions.

The original 802.11 Wi-Fi standard worked only at 1 Mbps. It has been revised many times, with each iteration specifying different signaling and transmission mechanisms. Products conforming to the various standards can be certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance.

---

### Wi-Fi Standards Evolution (802.11 Generations)

The specific range of radio frequencies a wireless device operates on is referred to as a **channel**, within an overall frequency band of either 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz (and now 6 GHz with Wi-Fi 6E).

### 2.4 GHz Band vs. 5 GHz Band

| Feature                  | 2.4 GHz Band                                                               | 5 GHz Band                                                                                             |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Propagation** | Better at propagating through solid surfaces, providing a longer signal range. | Less effective at penetrating solid surfaces, resulting in a shorter maximum signal range.               |
| **Channels & Congestion**| Does not support a high number of channels and is often congested (channels overlap considerably). | Supports a higher number of individual channels, suffering less congestion (non-overlapping channels). |
| **Interference & Data Rate** | Increased risk of interference, achievable data rates are typically lower. | Less risk of interference, supports higher data rate transmission at shorter signal ranges.              |

### IEEE 802.11 Generations (Wi-Fi 1 through Wi-Fi 6)

1.  **802.11b (Wi-Fi 1)**:
    * Uses the **2.4 GHz** frequency band.
    * Standardized **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)** with **Complementary Code Keying (CCK)** signal encoding.
    * Nominal rate of **11 Mbps**.
    * The 2.4 GHz band is subdivided into up to 14 channels (spaced at 5 MHz intervals). Because Wi-Fi needs ~20 MHz channel bandwidth, 802.11b channels **overlap considerably**. This means co-channel interference is a real possibility unless widely spaced channels are chosen (e.g., 1, 6, and 11).

2.  **802.11a (Wi-Fi 2)**:
    * Uses the **5 GHz** frequency band.
    * Uses a multiplexed carrier scheme called **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)**.
    * Nominal rate of **54 Mbps**.
    * The 5 GHz band is subdivided into many (e.g., 23 non-overlapping) 20 MHz wide channels.
    * Introduced **Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS)** to prevent APs from interfering with radar and satellite signals. Less likely to suffer co-channel interference due to its wider channel spacing.

3.  **802.11g (Wi-Fi 3)**:
    * An upgrade from 802.11b, operating in the **2.4 GHz** band.
    * Uses **OFDM** (like 802.11a) but with the 2.4 GHz band's channel layout.
    * Nominal data rate of **54 Mbps**.
    * Offers **backward compatibility** for legacy 802.11b clients. When in compatibility mode, it reverts to using DSSS instead of OFDM.

4.  **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**:
    * Introduced **Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)** and **Channel Bonding**, significantly increasing bandwidth.
    * **MIMO:** Multiplexes signals from 2 to 4 separate antennas for simultaneous transmission and reception, boosting bandwidth and improving signal reliability. The configuration is identified by `A x B:C` notation (A = #Tx antennas, B = #Rx antennas, C = #simultaneous Tx/Rx streams, max 4x4:4).
    * **Spatial Multiplexing:** Like using multiple highway lanes to transmit/receive data simultaneously.
    * **Spatial Diversity:** Combining signals from multiple antennas to derive a stronger signal and increase range at a given data rate.
    * Can use channels in both **2.4 GHz and 5 GHz** frequency bands.
    * **Channel Bonding:** Allows 2 adjacent 20 MHz channels to be combined into a single 40 MHz channel (a practical option mainly in the 5 GHz band due to less congestion).
    * A **Dual-Band AP** supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz simultaneously.
    * Data rate is 7.2 Mbps per stream, up to **600 Mbps** for a 40 MHz bonded channel with optimal 4x4:4 MIMO configuration.
    * Can operate in **High-Throughput (HT)/Greenfield mode** for maximum performance or **HT Mixed mode** for compatibility with older standards. Greenfield mode can cause substantial interference if legacy WLANs are operating nearby.

5.  **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**:
    * Designed to work **only in the 5 GHz band**. The 2.4 GHz band can be used for legacy standards in mixed mode.
    * Aims to deliver **Very High Throughput (VHT)**, often gigabit Ethernet speeds or better.
    * Supports more channel bonding (e.g., 80 MHz, 160 MHz channels) and up to 8 simultaneous spatial streams with denser modulation at closer ranges.
    * Introduced **Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO)** for downlink (AP to client) transmissions.
    * APs are marketed using AC values (e.g., AC5300, indicating total theoretical throughput across bands).

6.  **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**:
    * Uses more complex modulation and signal encoding to improve the amount of data sent per packet by about 40%. Designated as **High Efficiency (HE) Wi-Fi**.
    * Approximate bandwidth of **10 Gigabit speeds**, which can be achieved through the use of the **6 GHz frequency band (Wi-Fi 6E)**.
    * Reinstates operation in the **2.4 GHz band**, mostly to support IoT device connectivity.
    * Introduced **OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access)** modulation scheme, allowing sub-carriers or "tones" to be allocated in groups of different sizes (Resource Units - RUs), each of which can communicate in parallel. RUs can be assigned based on Class of Service (CoS) parameters (e.g., prioritizing VoIP traffic).
        * Large RUs: More bandwidth, fewer devices transmit.
        * Small RUs: Less bandwidth, more devices transmit.
    * **MU-MIMO and OFDMA** are complementary technologies: MU-MIMO makes use of spatial streams, while OFDMA makes flexible use of sub-carriers within a channel. Both can work together to increase parallelism and support communication with more devices simultaneously.
    * **Beamforming (MU-MIMO)**: Like adjusting a spotlight to focus on specific stations (devices) instead of broadcasting signals in all directions. It directs a stronger, more concentrated signal to targeted stations, improving speed and efficiency for multiple client stations.
        * **Downlink (DL) MU-MIMO:** Allows the AP to initiate and use its multiple antennas to process spatial streams of signals in one direction separately to other streams, meaning groups of stations can connect simultaneously and obtain bandwidth.
        * Wi-Fi 5 supports up to 4 stations in parallel over 5 GHz only.
        * Wi-Fi 6 supports up to 8 stations in 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands.
        * **Uplink (UL) MU-MIMO:** Wi-Fi 6 supports stations initiating beamforming with the AP.

### Wireless LAN Fundamentals & Architecture

### Service Sets and SSIDs

* **Service Sets** are groups of wireless devices.
* **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: A unique network name (up to 32 bytes in length) that identifies a WLAN. For maximum compatibility, it's best to only use ASCII letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores. APs send **Beacon frames** periodically to advertise their SSID.
* **BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier)**: The MAC address of the Access Point that forms the Basic Service Set. Each BSS has a unique BSSID.

### Wireless Network Topologies

1.  **Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) / Ad Hoc Mode**:
    * A wireless network where two or more wireless stations connect directly without an AP.
    * Does not require an Access Point.
    * All stations within an Ad Hoc network must be within range of one another.
    * Suits small workgroups, but not scalable for large networks.

2.  **Basic Service Set (BSS) / Infrastructure Mode**:
    * Clients connect to each other via an Access Point.
    * Wireless devices (clients/stations) request to **associate** with the BSS.
    * The area around an AP where its signal is usable is called a **Basic Service Area (BSA)** or Wireless Cell Segment.

3.  **Extended Service Set (ESS)**:
    * Used to create larger Wireless LANs beyond the range of a single AP.
    * Multiple APs, each with its own BSS (and unique BSSID), are connected by a wired network to a switch or Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
    * Each BSS within an ESS uses the **same SSID** and security configuration.
    * Each BSS uses a **different channel** to avoid interference where their BSAs overlap.
    * **Roaming**: Clients can pass seamlessly between multiple APs in an Extended Service Area (ESA) without having to reconnect, if configured with the same SSID and security. If `802.11r` (fast roaming) is supported, it may use existing authentication status to generate security properties for the new association.
    * The upstream wired network connecting the APs is called the **Distribution System (DS)**.
    * Each wireless BSS or ESS is mapped to a **VLAN** in the wired network.
    * It's possible for an AP to provide **Multiple Wireless LANs**, each with a unique SSID (creating different broadcast domains), and each WLAN can be mapped to a separate VLAN.

4.  **Mesh Basic Service Set (MBSS) / Wireless Mesh Network (WMN)**:
    * Used in situations where it's difficult to run Ethernet connections to every Access Point.
    * Mesh APs use two radios: one to provide a BSS to wireless clients and one to form a "Backhaul Network" for bridging traffic from AP to AP.
    * At least one AP is connected to the wired network and is called the **Root Access Point (RAP)**. Other APs are called **Mesh Access Points (MAPs)**.
    * A routing protocol (e.g., **Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol - HWMP**) is used to determine effective paths.
    * Mesh topology is more scalable than ad-hoc because stations do not need to be within direct radio range of one another; transmissions can be relayed by intermediate stations.

### Association Process and Connection States

Wireless clients go through a process to connect to an AP:

* **Management Messages:** Not Authenticated, Not Associated
* **Authentication Request/Response:** Authenticated, Not Associated
* **Association Request/Response:** Authenticated & Associated
* **Data Messages:** Authenticated & Associated

---

### Wireless Deployment Models

There are three main types of Wireless Deployment models: Autonomous, Lightweight (Controller-Based), and Cloud-Based.

1.  **Autonomous APs ("Fat APs")**:
    * Self-contained systems that don't rely on a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).
    * Each AP is configured individually (IP address for remote management, RF parameters, security policies, QoS rules).
    * Data traffic from wireless clients has a very direct path to the wired network.
    * Best practice to keep management traffic separate (e.g., different subnet/VLAN).
    * Each VLAN has to stretch across the entire network.

2.  **Lightweight APs ("Thin APs") with a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**:
    * Not self-contained; functions are split between the AP and a WLC (Split-MAC Architecture).
    * **Thin APs handle "real-time operations"**: Transmitting/receiving traffic, encrypting/decrypting traffic, sending beacons/probes.
    * **WLC handles "management operations"**: RF management, security policies, client association/dissociation, roaming management, QoS management.
    * The WLC can be located in the same subnet/VLAN as the lightweight APs it manages, or in a different subnet.
    * APs and WLCs authenticate each other using digital certificates.
    * They communicate using **CAPWAP (Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points)** protocol (UDP port 5246 for control tunnel, UDP port 5247 for data tunnel).
        * **Control Tunnel (UDP 5246):** Used to configure and manage AP operations; traffic is encrypted by default (DTLS - Datagram Transport Layer Security).
        * **Data Tunnel (UDP 5247):** All traffic from wireless clients is sent through this tunnel to the WLC (encapsulated with new headers); it does not go directly to the wired network.
    * **Benefits of Split-MAC Architecture:** Scalability, transmit power optimization, seamless roaming, dynamic channel assignment, client load balancing, self-healing wireless coverage, centralized security/QoS management.

3.  **Cloud-Based AP Architecture**:
    * A hybrid between autonomous APs and split-MAC architecture.
    * Autonomous APs that are centrally managed in the cloud (e.g., Cisco Meraki).
    * A cloud dashboard is used to configure APs, monitor the network, generate performance reports, and control settings like dynamic channel assignment and power optimization.
    * **Data traffic is NOT sent to the cloud**; it goes directly to the wired network (like autonomous APs). Only management (control) traffic and telemetry info are sent to the cloud.

### WLC Deployment Models

* **Unified (Hardware Appliance):** The WLC is a hardware appliance in a central location of the network (good for hundreds of APs).
* **Cloud-Based (VM):** The WLC is a VM running on a server, usually in a private cloud or data center (good for thousands of APs).
* **Embedded:** The WLC is integrated within a switch (good for up to 200 APs).
* **Mobility Express:** The WLC is integrated within an AP (good for up to 100 APs).

## Installing Wireless Networks

Designing a wireless network to meet requirements for multiple device types can be complex, ensuring that range and interference issues are accounted for. Wireless network devices are referred to as **stations**.

### Infrastructure Topology

* In an infrastructure topology, each station is configured to connect with a **Base Station or Access Point (AP)**, forming a logical star topology.
* The AP mediates communications between client devices and can also provide a bridge to a cabled network segment.
* The MAC address of the AP is used as the **BSSID**.
* Clients are configured to join a WLAN through the **Network Name or SSID**.
* The area served by a single AP is referred to as a **Basic Service Area (BSA)** or Wireless Cell Segment.
* The area in which stations can roam between APs to stay connected to the same SSID is referred to as an **Extended Service Area (ESA)**.

### SSID Broadcasting

* WLANs are configured to advertise their presence by **broadcasting their SSID**.
* If SSID broadcast is suppressed, user stations must configure the connection to the network manually. However, network sniffers can still detect the SSID even with broadcast disabled.
* A special management frame broadcast by an AP to advertise the WLAN is known as a **Beacon frame**.
* The Beacon frame contains the SSID (unless disabled), supported data rates, signaling, encryption, and authentication requirements.
* The default interval for beacon broadcasts is 100 milliseconds. Increasing this interval reduces overhead but can delay stations joining the network and hamper roaming.

### Site Survey

A **site survey** is a critical planning tool to ensure the WLAN delivers acceptable data rates to the supported number of devices in all expected physical locations.

* A Wi-Fi device usually has an indoor range of at least 30m/100ft. 2.4 GHz radios support better distance ranges than 5 GHz ones, but Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n) and later standards improve range. Outdoor range can be double or triple indoor range.
* Each station determines an appropriate data rate based on signal quality using **Dynamic Rate Switching/Selection (DRS)**. If the signal is strong, the station selects the highest available data rate; otherwise, it lowers the rate.
* Radio signals pass through solid objects but can be weakened or blocked by thick walls (e.g., dense concrete). Other radio-based devices (microwave ovens, heavy machinery, cordless phones) can cause interference.
* **Site Survey Process:**
    1.  Examine blueprints/floor plans to understand the layout and identify features causing RF interference. Back this up with a visual inspection.
    2.  Note locations of available network ports and power jacks for AP mounting. A switch that supports **Power over Ethernet (PoE)** can be used for PoE-compatible APs.
    3.  Create a plan marking WLAN cells, associated APs, and booster antennas. The goal is to place APs close enough to avoid "dead zones" (areas with difficult connectivity or low data rates) but far enough apart to prevent one AP from interfering with another, or from being over/underutilized.
    4.  Position an AP in the first planned location. Use a device with a wireless adapter and a Wi-Fi survey tool (e.g., Cisco Aironet, Ekahau Site Survey, NetAlly, MetaGeek InSSIDer) to record signal strength. Many tools can show signal strength within a particular channel graphically using a **Heat Map** (e.g., strong signal = green, low signal = orange/red).
    5.  This step is repeated for each planned location. Neighboring APs should be configured with **non-overlapping channels** to avoid interference.

### Wireless Roaming and Bridging

* Clients can roam within an **Extended Service Area (ESA)**.
* An ESA is created by installing APs with the same SSID and security configuration, connected by a wired network.
* The APs are configured with different channels to prevent interference where their BSAs overlap.
* If a client station detects a low signal, it checks for another stronger signal with the same SSID on other channels or a different frequency band, then disassociates from the current AP and reassociates with the new AP.
* Depending on the roaming infrastructure and security type, the client might have to re-authenticate. If 802.11r (fast roaming) is supported, it may use existing authentication status.
* Adapters support a "roaming aggressiveness" setting to prevent "flapping" (rapidly switching between two APs) and ensure the station disassociates from a distant, low-bandwidth AP.

### Wireless Distribution System (WDS)

* WDS is a configuration of multiple APs to cover areas where cabling is impossible.
* APs are configured in **WDS/Repeater mode**. One AP is configured as a **Base Station** (connected to a cabled segment), while others are configured as **Remote Stations**.
* Remote stations don't need to be connected to cable segments but can accept connections from wireless stations and forward all traffic to the base station.
* Another use of WDS is **bridging two separate cable segments**. When WDS is configured in **Bridge Mode**, the APs will not support wireless clients; they simply forward traffic between cabled segments. Best to use APs from the same vendor.

## Wireless Configuration via GUI/CLI

### WLAN Controller (WLC) Connectivity

* The WLC connects to a switch via a **Link Aggregation Group (LAG)** (also known as EtherChannel). WLCs often only support static LAG, not PAgP or LACP.
* **DHCP Option 43** can be used to tell APs the IP address of their WLC.

### WLC Ports and Interfaces

* **WLC Ports** are the physical ports that cables connect to.
* **WLC Interfaces** are the logical interfaces within the WLC (similar to SVIs on a switch).

1.  **Service Port:** A dedicated management port used for **out-of-band management**. Must connect to a switch access port as it only supports one VLAN. Used to connect to the device while it is booting.
2.  **Distribution System (DS) Ports:** Standard network ports that connect to the **Distribution System (wired network)** and are used for data traffic. These ports usually connect to switch trunk ports. If multiple, they can form a LAG.
3.  **Console Port:** Standard console port, using either RJ-45 or USB.
4.  **Redundancy Port:** Used to connect to another WLC to form a **High Availability (HA) pair** (one active, one standby).
5.  **Management Interface:** Used for management traffic such as Telnet, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, RADIUS authentication, NTP, syslog, etc. CAPWAP tunnels are also formed from the WLC management interface.
6.  **Redundancy Management Interface:** When two WLCs are connected by their redundancy ports, this interface can be used to connect to and manage the "standby" WLC.
7.  **Virtual Interface:** This interface is used when communicating with wireless clients, relaying DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, etc. It's a logical interface that doesn't map directly to a physical port.
8.  **Service Port Interface:** If the service port is in use, this logical interface is bound to it.
9.  **Dynamic Interface:** These are the interfaces used to map a VLAN to a WLAN (i.e., a specific SSID).

## Wireless Network Security

Wireless networks, while offering mobility and convenience, pose considerable security risks if not properly secured with access controls. All clients must be authenticated before they can associate with an Access Point (AP). In corporate settings, a separate SSID (Service Set Identifier) with restricted access can be provided for guest Internet access, keeping them off the main corporate network.

### Authentication Methods

Here are multiple ways to authenticate clients on a wireless network, broadly categorized by their approach:

* **Open Authentication:** No authentication is performed by the AP. Often used in conjunction with a **Captive Portal** (web page requiring credentials or agreement to terms) for guest access or public Wi-Fi.
* **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP):** (Legacy and insecure) An older standard aiming to provide both authentication and encryption.
* **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP):** A framework that defines a set of standardized authentication methods, widely used in modern wireless security.
    * **EAP over LAN (EAPOL):** Used for wired port-based network access control (IEEE 802.1X).
    * **EAP over Wireless (EAPOW):** Used for wireless port-based network access control (IEEE 802.1X).
* **Lightweight EAP (LEAP):** Cisco-developed, an improvement over WEP.
* **Protected EAP (PEAP):** Establishes a secure TLS tunnel.
* **EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling):** Cisco-developed, similar to PEAP but uses Protected Access Credentials (PACs).
* **EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security):** The most secure EAP method, requiring certificates on both the client and server.

### Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Framework

EAP is an authentication protocol that defines a set of standards. It's integrated with **IEEE 802.1X** (Port-based Network Access Control - PNAC), which is used to limit network access for clients until they authenticate.

**Three Main EAP Entities:**

1.  **Supplicant:** The end-host (client device) seeking network access.
2.  **Authenticator:** The network access device (e.g., switch, router, Access Point, WLC) that restricts access and forwards authentication requests.
3.  **Authentication Server / AAA Server / RADIUS / TACACS+:** The server that performs the actual authentication logic.

### WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

* An older security protocol designed to provide both authentication and encryption for WLANs.
* Uses the **RC4 stream cipher**.
* It's a shared-key protocol, meaning clients connect using a pre-shared key.
* WEP keys are typically **40-bit or 104-bit** in length.
* The WEP key is combined with a **24-bit Initialization Vector (IV)** for encryption.
* **WEP encryption is not secure** due to vulnerabilities in the RC4 key scheduling algorithm and the fixed IV.
* **Authentication in WEP** was based on a simple challenge-response (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol - CHAP), which is also insecure.

### Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP)

* Developed by Cisco as an improvement over WEP.
* Clients must provide a username/password to authenticate.
* **Mutual authentication** is provided, where both the client and server send challenge phrases to each other.
* Uses **dynamic WEP keys** that are changed frequently to mitigate some WEP vulnerabilities. Still not considered highly secure.

### Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)

* Like EAP-FAST, PEAP involves establishing a **secure TLS tunnel** between the client and the authentication server.
* The server's digital certificate is used to authenticate the server to the client and to establish the TLS tunnel.
* The client is then authenticated to the server using a less secure method (e.g., **MS-CHAPv2**) *within the protected tunnel*.
* PEAP requires the authentication server to have a digital certificate.

### EAP-FAST (Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)

* Developed by Cisco, often consists of three phases:
    1.  **PAC (Protected Access Credential) Provisioning:** A secure credential (PAC) is securely provisioned to the client.
    2.  **Secure TLS Tunnel Establishment:** A secure TLS tunnel is established using the PAC.
    3.  **Further Communication within Secure Tunnel:** Further authentication or communication takes place within the established tunnel.
* Unlike PEAP, EAP-FAST does not require the authentication server to have a digital certificate (though it can use one). It primarily relies on PACs for mutual authentication.

### EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)

* Requires **both the client and the server to have digital certificates**. This makes it the most secure authentication method, but also the most difficult to implement due to the certificate management overhead (every client device needs a certificate).
* The TLS tunnel is used for key information exchange, but no further authentication is needed within the tunnel because both parties are already authenticated by their certificates.

### Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) and Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CCMP)

These are cryptographic protocols used for encryption and integrity in modern wireless security:

* **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol):**
    * Used in WPA.
    * Combines the RC4 cipher with enhancements designed to address WEP vulnerabilities (e.g., per-packet keying, message integrity check - MIC).
    * Still uses RC4, making it susceptible to some attacks, and is considered less secure than AES.
* **CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol):**
    * Used in WPA2.
    * Combines the **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) cipher** in Counter Mode (CTR) with **CBC-MAC (Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code)** for data integrity and authentication.
    * Replaced TKIP for stronger security.
* **GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol):**
    * Used in WPA3.
    * Combines **AES** in Galois/Counter Mode for both encryption and authentication. Offers better performance and stronger security than CCMP.

---

## WIRELESS PROTECTED ACCESS (WPA, WPA2, WPA3)

The choice of security settings depends on device support for various Wi-Fi encryption standards, the type of authentication infrastructure, and the purpose of the WLAN. These standards determine the cryptographic protocols supported, key generation methods, and available authentication methods.

### WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) - Version 1

* Designed to counter vulnerabilities in the WEP standard.
* Like WEP, WPA uses the **RC4 stream cipher** to encrypt traffic.
* It adds **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)** to mitigate attacks against WEP. TKIP provides per-packet keying, message integrity checks (MIC), and rekeying, making replay attacks harder than with WEP.
* **Vulnerable to some replay attacks** that aim to recover the encryption key, as it still uses RC4.

### WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)

* **Uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** cipher deployed within the **CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)**.
* **AES replaces RC4**, and **CCMP replaces TKIP**.
* CCMP provides both authentication and encryption, designed to make replay attacks much harder.
* WPA2 is generally considered secure.
* **Protected Management Frames (PMF)** are an optional feature in WPA2, made mandatory in WPA3, to protect critical management frames from spoofing and denial-of-service attacks.

### WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)

* Uses the **same AES and GCMP** as WPA2.
* However, the method by which session keys are agreed upon changes from the WPA2 4-way handshake to **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)**.
* **SAE** (also referred to as Password Authenticated Key Exchange - PAKE) provides stronger protection against dictionary attacks and ensures forward secrecy.

### WPA Modes: Personal vs. Enterprise

Wireless security comes in two main flavors (and an "Open" category):

1.  **Personal (Pre-Shared Key - PSK / SAE):**
    * Also known as **WPA2-Personal** (WPA2-PSK) or **WPA3-Personal** (WPA3-SAE).
    * Uses a passphrase to generate the key that is used to encrypt communications.
    * Referred to as **group authentication** because all users share the same secret.
    * The administrator configures a passphrase (8-63 characters, 64 hex characters). This is converted to a hash value, known as the **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**.
    * The PMK is used as part of the WPA2 4-way handshake or WPA3 SAE to derive various session keys.
    * **WPA2-PSK is vulnerable to dictionary attacks** if a weak passphrase is used, as the 4-way handshake can be captured offline and brute-forced.
    * **WPA3-Personal (SAE)** changes the key agreement method to mitigate these dictionary attacks. It provides a more robust and secure key exchange, even with weak passwords.
    * An AP can be configured for WPA3-only or with support for legacy WPA2, known as **WPA3-Personal Transition Mode**.

2.  **Enterprise (IEEE 802.1X Authentication for WPA2 or WPA3):**
    * Also known as **WPA2-Enterprise** or **WPA3-Enterprise**.
    * Addresses the limitations of the Personal model (e.g., distribution of keys, lack of accounting).
    * Implements **IEEE 802.1X** to use an **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)** to authenticate against a network directory (e.g., RADIUS server, Active Directory).
    * 802.1X defines the use of **EAP over Wireless (EAPOW)** to allow an AP to forward authentication data without allowing any other type of network access initially.
    * **Authentication Process:**
        1.  When a wireless client requests an association, the AP enables the channel only for EAPOW traffic.
        2.  The AP passes the credentials of the Supplicant to an **AAA Server** on the wired network for validation.
        3.  When the Supplicant has been authenticated, the AAA server transmits a **Master Key** back to the Supplicant, with which both the client and AP derive the same **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**.
        4.  The wireless station and AP use the PMK to derive session keys, using either the WPA2 4-way handshake or the WPA3 Simultaneous Authentication of Equals method.
    * Provides centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).


## Troubleshooting Wireless Networks

Wireless network deployments can be complicated by various environmental and performance demands. A variety of tools and techniques are available to assess Wi-Fi performance and ensure a highly available network for all users.

Wireless issues can be broadly categorized into problems with:
1.  **Signal Strength / Interference**
2.  **Configuration Issues** (especially security and authentication)
3.  **Differences in Speed and Throughput**

### Wireless Performance Metrics

* **Speed (Data Rate):** The data rate established at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) and Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
    * Determined by Wi-Fi standards used (e.g., 802.11n, ac, ax), bonded channels, and optimization techniques such as MU-MIMO.
    * If sender and receiver are far apart or subject to interference, a lower data rate is negotiated to make the link reliable.
* **Throughput:** The amount of data that can be transferred at the Network Layer (Layer 3), discarding overhead from Layers 1 and 2.
    * Often used to describe the actual data transfer achieved at the Application Layer, accounting for packet loss and retransmissions.

### 1. Signal Issues

* **Attenuation:** The weakening of the signal as the distance between the station and the access point (AP) increases. Also referred to as **Radio Frequency (RF) Attenuation** or **Free Space Loss**.
    * As the distance from the antenna increases, the strength of the signal decreases in accordance with the **Inverse-Square Law**.
* **Interference:** Various interference sources collectively overlay a competing background signal, creating noise.
* **Measurement Units (dBm):** Attenuation and signal strength are measured in decibels (dB). Signal strength is represented as a ratio of a measurement to 1 milliwatt (mW).
    * `0 dBm = 1 mW`.
    * **dBm** is a unit of level used to indicate that a power ratio is expressed in decibels with reference to 1 milliwatt. It's convenient for expressing both large and small values concisely.
    * Formula: `Power (dBm) = 10 * log10 (Power (mW) / 1 mW)`
    * If `Power (mW) = 1 mW`, `Power (dBm) = 0 dBm`.
    * To convert back to milliwatts: `Power (mW) = 10^(Power (dBm) / 10)`
    * A negative dBm value represents a fraction of a milliwatt (e.g., `-3 dBm` is half a milliwatt). Positive values represent power more than 1 mW.
    * The conversion is logarithmic: every increase/decrease of 3 dBm equates to a doubling/halving of power. Every increase/decrease of 10 dBm equates to a tenfold increase/decrease in power.

* **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI):** The strength of the signal from the transmitting station at the client end.
    * When measuring RSSI in dBm, it will be a negative value (a fraction of a milliwatt), with **values closer to zero representing better performance** (e.g., `-65 dBm` is better performance than `-80 dBm`).
    * An RSSI of `-80 dBm` to `-90 dBm` is likely to suffer packet loss or be dropped entirely.
    * The RSSI must exceed the **minimum receiver sensitivity** of the client adapter.
    * RSSI can also be an index value related to a scale of raw measurements (e.g., 0-60, 0-127, or 0-255). On a client, this index is often displayed as a number of "bars" on the adapter icon.

* **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR):** The comparative strength of the data signal to the background noise.
    * Noise is also measured in dBm, but here, values closer to zero are less desirable as they represent higher noise levels.
    * RSSI and SNR can be measured using a **Wi-Fi analyzer** installed on an adapter or a dedicated spectrum analyzer.

### Antennas

* Antennas determine the propagation pattern (shape of radio waves transmitted/received).
* **Omnidirectional Antennas:**
    * Send and receive signals in all directions (radiate more equally).
    * The propagation pattern is shaped like a donut, radiating more powerfully in the horizontal plane than in the vertical plane.
    * Generally used for broader coverage areas.
* **Unidirectional (Directional) Antennas:**
    * Focus the signal in a particular direction.
    * Increase in signal strength obtained by focusing the signal is referred to as **Gain**, measured in **dBi (decibels isotropic)**.
    * Both sender and receiver must use directional antennas for point-to-point wireless links.
    * Examples: Yagi, parabolic grid (very highly directional for long connections).
    * **Beamwidth:** Measured in degrees, representing the angle of the main lobe of radiation. Omni-directional antennas have a wider beamwidth (e.g., 360° horizontal), while directional antennas have narrower beamwidths (e.g., 10°, 90°).

* **Polarization:** Refers to the orientation of the wave propagating from the antenna (e.g., vertical, horizontal).
    * To maximize signal strength, the transmitting (Tx) antenna and receiving (Rx) antenna should normally use the same polarization. This is particularly important when deploying unidirectional antennas for point-to-point links.
    * Some antennas are **dual-polarized**, meaning they can be installed in either orientation or support both simultaneously. Dual-polarized antennas are often best to support mobile devices, as these can be held by their user in a variety of orientations.

* **Insufficient Wireless Coverage (Dead Spots):**
    * Refers to spots within a building with no or weak Wi-Fi signal.
    * If sufficient signal strength cannot be obtained or interference cannot be mitigated, the only solution is to install additional APs to cover the gap.
    * If you cannot extend the cabled distribution network system to support additional APs, you will need to configure a wireless bridge or use a **range extender** (which extends two separate cabled segments wirelessly).

* **Antenna Placement:**
    * Incorrect antenna placement can cause or worsen attenuation and interference problems.
    * Use a **site survey** and **heat map** to determine the optimum position for APs and the direction in which to point adjustable antennas.
    * Using an incorrect antenna type can adversely affect signal strength (e.g., an AP designed for ceiling mounting produces a stronger signal directed downwards, whereas a wall-mounted AP's signal is angled outwards).

* **Antenna Cable Attenuation:**
    * Signal loss occurs when an antenna is connected at some distance from the access point via coaxial cabling.
    * Higher quality cable (e.g., LMR/HDF/CFD 400 series at approx. 0.22 dB/meter) has less attenuation than lower quality (e.g., LMR/HDF/CFD 200 series at approx. 0.6 dB/meter).
    * Connector loss (e.g., 0.15 dB per connector) is also calculated.
    * For devices with removable antennas, a loose or disconnected antenna will significantly reduce range and connectivity.

* **Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) & Power Settings:**
    * **EIRP** is the total power radiated from the antenna, accounting for transmission power, antenna gain, and cable/connector losses.
    * `EIRP = Transmit Power (dBm) + Antenna Gain (dBi) - Cable/Connector Losses (dB)`
    * This value for each radio is reported through the AP or controller management software.
    * **Regulatory Limits:** Power limits must not exceed regulatory limits, which differ for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands and for point-to-point versus point-to-multipoint operation modes.
    * **Ineffectiveness of High Power:** Increasing transmit power is not usually an effective solution to improve wireless coverage. If the client station detects a strong signal, it will set a high data rate. However, because the EIRP of the client radio is typically much lower, it fails to transmit a strong signal back to the AP, resulting in excessive packet errors (the "AP can hear the client, but the client can't hear the AP" problem).
    * **Rule of Thumb:** AP power should be roughly 4/3rds of the weakest client radio power. For example, if the weakest client can output 12 dBm, the AP should transmit at 9-10 dBm.

### Channel Utilization and Overlap Issues

* **Channel Overlap:** Refers to interference resulting from multiple access points that are all in range of one another and are configured to use similar RF wavelengths (channels).
* **Co-Channel Interference (CCI):**
    * Accurately described as contention for an RF channel when multiple access points use the same channel. Opportunities to transmit are reduced.
    * Wireless stations must then use **CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)** to find transmit opportunities.
    * CCI is measured as a percentage referred to as **channel utilization** using a Wi-Fi analyzer.
    * **Design Goal:** A channel should exhibit no more than 50% utilization for optimal performance.
* **Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI):**
    * Occurs when access points are configured to different but **overlapping channels**, such as channels 1 and 3 in the 2.4 GHz band.
    * ACI slows down the CSMA/CA process and raises noise levels.

**Channel Planning:**

* One of the design goals for a multi-AP site is to create "clean cells" so that clients can select an AP with the strongest signal easily and the Wi-Fi operates with a minimum of co-channel interference.
* In the 2.4 GHz band, there are only 3 non-overlapping channels (1, 6, 11). For example, select channel 1 for APx, channel 6 for APy, and channel 11 for APz.
* In the 5 GHz band (for 802.11a/n/ac/ax), more non-overlapping channels are available, and channels are generally wider (e.g., 20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz, 160MHz). At least 25 MHz channel spans should be allowed to avoid channel overlap in the 5 GHz band.
* **Power Level Adjustment:** Adjusting the power level used by an AP on a given channel is advantageous. Using the maximum available power on an AP can result in interfering with other cells and situations where a client can "hear" the AP but cannot "talk" to it because it lacks sufficient power (as discussed in EIRP).
* **Roaming:** In order to enable seamless roaming for mobile clients, the cells or Basic Service Areas (BSAs) served by each AP need to overlap to some extent. Issues with roaming can be identified by analyzing access point association times for clients. A WLAN Controller will track client mobility, showing each AP and the time the client associated with it. A large number of clients "flapping" (repeatedly associating and disassociating) between two APs indicates a roaming issue.

### Overload Capacity / Client Saturation

* **Client Saturation:** Occurs when too many client stations connect to an AP, causing performance degradation.
* The maximum number of clients an AP can support varies depending on the Wi-Fi standard used and the type of network traffic generated. A maximum of 30 clients per AP is a generally accepted rule of thumb.
* **Design Goal:** Enough APs should be provided in appropriate locations to support the expected client density at this ratio.
* APs can be configured to enforce a maximum number of connections; additional clients will then connect to the nearest available AP.
* Even with a low number of clients, wireless networks can suffer from bandwidth saturation because it's a broadcast medium, meaning the available bandwidth is shared among all clients.
* A **Wireless LAN Controller** will normally provide reporting tools to manage and diagnose bandwidth issues, report on wireless channel utilization, and configure APs and clients to reassign channels dynamically to reduce over-utilization.
* If a **Traffic Shaper** is deployed, it may work automatically to throttle bandwidth to over-utilized clients.

### Environmental Factors Causing Weak Signal / No Connection

If a device is within the supported range but the signal is weak or there's no connection, interference or physical obstructions are likely.

1.  **Reflection / Bounce (Multipath Interference):**
    * Mirrors, metal surfaces, and other solid objects cause signals to reflect, meaning that a variable delay is introduced, causing packet loss and data rate decrease.
    * However, Wi-Fi 4/5/6 (802.11n/ac/ax) standards use multipath (via **MIMO**) as a means of optimizing throughput and range.
2.  **Refraction:** Glass or water (e.g., fish tanks) can cause radio waves to bend and take a different path to the receiver radio, causing signal distortion.
3.  **Absorption:** The degree to which solid materials reduce signal strength as the wave's energy is lost as heat when passing through construction materials.
    * The 2.4 GHz band generally has better penetration through objects than the 5 GHz band.
    * Ceiling-mounted APs are often favored to minimize absorption from office furniture.
    * An internal wall might cause 3-7 dBm of absorption.
4.  **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):**
    * Interference from other powerful radio or electromagnetic sources working in the same frequency band (e.g., microwaves, cordless phones, Bluetooth devices, industrial equipment).
    * Detected using a **Spectrum Analyzer**. This specialized radio receiver filters out anything that isn't a Wi-Fi signal.
    * Usually supplied as handheld units with a directional antenna, so the exact location of the interference can be pinpointed.
    * A 6 dBm change in the level of a particular source reflects a halving/doubling of the distance between the analyzer and the source of the RF interference.

## 2. Wi-Fi Security Configuration Issues

### Wrong SSID and Incorrect Passphrase Issues

* **SSID (Service Set Identifier):** The network name. If the SSID is suppressed (hidden), clients must connect to the AP/WLAN by entering the network name manually.
* **Troubleshooting:**
    * Ensure clients are configured to transmit the correct SSID. Remember that the value is case-sensitive.
    * Check authentication settings are the same on all devices (client and AP).
    * If a passphrase is used (e.g., WPA2-Personal), ensure it is entered correctly.
    * Unless the WLAN is meant to provide public, unrestricted access, **do not set the authentication type to "Open"**.
    * It's possible that two APs are operating with the same SSID. If authentication is wrong, connection to the wrong SSID will fail.
    * If a user is joining the WLAN for the first time, there might be SSIDs from overlapping WLANs with very similar default names, leading to user confusion about which to choose.

### Encryption Protocol Mismatch Issues

* If the user is definitely supplying the correct key or credentials, check that the client can support the encryption and authentication standards configured on the AP.
* A device update or OS patch may be required for the client.
* Even if the credentials are supplied correctly, a connection will fail if the encryption protocol (e.g., WPA2 AES vs. WPA3) is mismatched.

### Client Disassociation Issues

* Access points and client stations normally use management frames to control connections.
* Using **beacon frames**, clients can choose to authenticate if they are in range of an AP's Basic Service Area (BSA).
* The client or AP can use **Disassociation** or **Deauthentication** frames to notify the other party about a connection ending.
* A legitimate client might disassociate but not deauthenticate because it's roaming to another wireless AP within an Extended Service Area (ESA).
* **Troubleshooting:** Investigate the AP or WLAN Controller event log to identify the cause of disassociations, especially if clients are found "flapping" between access points (indicating a roaming issue).
* If clients are disassociated unexpectedly and there is no roaming involved, consider interference or driver issues.
* **Malicious Attacks:** Also consider the possibility of a malicious attack.
    * **Disassociation Attack:** Exploits the lack of encryption on management frame traffic to send spoofed frames.
        * One type rejects management frames that spoof the MAC address of a single victim station in a disassociation notification, causing it to be disconnected from the network.
        * Another variant broadcasts spoofed frames to disconnect all client stations.
    * Disassociation and Deauthentication attacks are used to perform Denial of Service (DoS) against the wireless infrastructure or to exploit disconnected stations to try to force reconnection to a rogue AP ("Evil Twin"). They are also used in conjunction with a replay attack aimed at recovering the network key (e.g., cracking WPA/WPA2-Personal PSK).

### Open Authentication and Captive Portal Issues

* **Open Authentication** may be combined with a secondary authentication mechanism managed by a browser.
* When a client station associates with an Open AP (e.g., a hotspot) and launches the browser, the client is redirected to a **Captive Portal** (a "splash page"). This portal allows the client to authenticate to the hotspot provider's network (often over HTTPS, so the login is secure). Such portals may enforce terms and conditions or take payment.
* **Common Issues:** Most captive portal issues arise because the redirect does not work.
    * Modern browsers will block redirection to sites that do not use TLS/SSL. This means the portal itself needs to be installed with a digital certificate issued by a CA that is trusted by the client's browser.
* **Security Concern:** When using open wireless, data sent over the link is unencrypted. Users must ensure they:
    * Send confidential web data only over HTTPS connections.
    * Only use email, VoIP, and file transfer services with SSH/TLS enabled.
    * Another option for users is to force a VPN connection. The VPN must use certificate-based tunneling to set up the inner authenticated method for encrypting traffic over the untrusted network.

### Wireless Security Protocols (Evolution and Vulnerabilities)

* **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):**
    * **Weaknesses:** Uses an RC4 cipher and a static key. Vulnerable to various replay attacks (e.g., IV attacks). Easy to crack. **Deprecated.**
* **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) 1:**
    * **Improvements:** Uses RC4 cipher but introduces **TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)** to mitigate replay attacks by dynamically changing session keys. Still vulnerable to some attacks.
* **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access) (Current Standard for most deployments):**
    * **Improvements:** Uses **AES-CCMP (Advanced Encryption Standard - Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol)** for stronger encryption. Offers two modes:
        * **WPA2-Personal (PSK - Pre-Shared Key):** Uses a passphrase for authentication. Suitable for home/small office. Vulnerable to dictionary attacks if the PSK is weak.
        * **WPA2-Enterprise:** Uses **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)** to authenticate users via an **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) server** (e.g., RADIUS, TACACS+). A unique Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is derived after authentication. Provides much stronger security, suitable for corporate environments.
* **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) (Latest Standard):**
    * **Improvements:** Uses **AES-GCMP** (GCM-based encryption). Introduces **SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)** handshake to mitigate dictionary attacks against the pre-shared key. Provides **Protected Management Frames (PMF)** to protect management traffic from spoofing/disassociation attacks.
    * **WPA3-Personal:** Stronger than WPA2-Personal.
    * **WPA3-Enterprise:** Adds 192-bit encryption for sensitive data.

## 3. Configuring and Troubleshooting Wireless Security

Wireless connections pose considerable risks unless properly secured with access controls. Identifying different wireless security methods, their configuration requirements, and troubleshooting common issues is crucial.

**General Considerations:**

* **Signal Strength vs. Security:** Strong signal does not equate to strong security.
* **Interference:** Other wireless devices or even physical objects can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, impacting performance and potentially security.
* **Rogue APs:** Unauthorized APs on the network can pose a significant security threat.
* **Client Compatibility:** Ensure that all client devices support the chosen security standard (e.g., WPA3-only networks will not allow WPA2-only clients).

**Troubleshooting Common Wireless Issues:**

* **Connectivity Issues:**
    * Incorrect SSID.
    * Incorrect passphrase/security key.
    * Outdated wireless adapter drivers.
    * Channel interference (check channel settings on AP and surrounding networks).
    * AP too far away (weak signal).
    * Client device not supporting the chosen Wi-Fi standard or security protocol.
* **Authentication Failures:**
    * Incorrect username/password (for Enterprise modes).
    * Misconfigured RADIUS server.
    * Client certificates expired or misconfigured (for EAP-TLS).
    * Time synchronization issues between client, AP, and authentication server.
* **Performance Issues:**
    * Co-channel interference (multiple APs on the same channel in proximity).
    * Adjacent channel interference (overlapping channels, especially in 2.4 GHz).
    * Legacy devices forcing the network into backward compatibility modes.
    * Too many clients on one AP.
    * Weak signal requiring lower data rates (DRS).
    * Firmware issues on AP or client.


## Guidelines for Deploying and Troubleshooting Wireless Networks

Following these guidelines will lead to more robust and easily manageable wireless networks.

1.  **Define Requirements:** Create a clear list of requirements (e.g., number of users, physical service area to cover, external connectivity needs).
2.  **Consider Client Compatibility:** Consider the client devices you need to support and their compatibility requirements in terms of Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11a/b/g, Wi-Fi 4/5/6).
3.  **Site Survey and Heat Maps:**
    * Obtain a blueprint or layout of the building.
    * Use a **Wi-Fi Analyzer** to perform a **site survey** and generate **heat maps** of signal strength and channel utilization. This helps to mitigate dead zones and co-channel/adjacent channel interference.
4.  **Determine AP Range:** Based on the chosen Wi-Fi technology, determine the effective range of the AP. This will help you better determine how many APs you will need to ensure adequate coverage for the space.
5.  **Balance Client Density:** Balance the number of users who will have access to each AP. Ensure that the APs cover all required employees within their range, while also considering client capacity limits.
6.  **Interference Check:** Tour the area within the range of the AP and check for any devices that will interfere with the wireless network (e.g., microwaves, cordless phones).
7.  **Obstacle Clearance:** Ensure that there are no significant obstacles (e.g., metal, water, thick walls) in the path of the AP that could obstruct the wireless signal.
8.  **AP Installation Steps (Vendor Specific but Common):**
    * Connect the AP to the cabled network / distribution network (via a switch, often with PoE).
    * Set the **SSID/ESSID** and an `802.11` beacon.
    * Configure frequency bands (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) and channel layout within each frequency band (e.g., 1, 6, 11 for 2.4 GHz).
    * Adjust transmit power to reduce channel overlap and excessive packet loss errors (find the right balance for cell size).
    * Configure the appropriate **encryption and authentication scheme** (e.g., WPA2/WPA3 Personal vs. WPA2/WPA3 Enterprise).
    * If appropriate (for Enterprise mode), configure RADIUS and/or TACACS+ support for enterprise authentication.
9.  **Real-World Testing:** Test the installation under real-world conditions to confirm it is appropriately sized, secure, and operational.
10. **Periodic Site Surveys and Documentation:**
    * Perform periodic site surveys to check RSSI at key locations and compare to previous performance levels.
    * **Document every step** and establish a baseline for future installations and troubleshooting.


Let's break down network types, characteristics, topology, and how they relate to performance, cabling, switching, and routing within the OSI model.

## Chapter 19: Software Defined Networking

## SOFTWARE-DEFINED WIDE AREA NETWORKING (SD-WAN)

Traditional hub-and-spoke WAN designs with on-premises data centers often suffer from performance and reliability drawbacks. While moving services to cloud data centers or using colocation mitigates some issues by separating service integrity and availability from site accessibility, a new approach is needed for modern connectivity demands.

**SD-WAN replaces the traditional hub-and-spoke design with more efficient, secure connectivity to corporate clouds, often at a lower expense compared to provisioning MPLS services to every remote location.**

### Key Characteristics of SD-WAN

* **Overlay Network:** An SD-WAN is a type of overlay network. This means it creates a logical network on top of existing physical "underlay" networks.
* **Multi-Location Access:** It provisions corporate WAN access across multiple locations (branch offices, remote worker locations, data centers).
* **Direct Cloud Access:** Facilitates secure, direct access to cloud services from a branch office or other remote location, bypassing the need to backhaul traffic through a central hub.
* **Automation & Orchestration:** SD-WAN uses automation and orchestration to dynamically provision links based on application requirements and network congestion.
* **Secure Tunnels:** It typically uses **IPsec** (Internet Protocol Security) to ensure that traffic is tunneled securely through the underlying transport networks.
* **Micro-segmentation & Zero Trust:** An SD-WAN solution should apply micro-segmentation and zero-trust policies to ensure all requests and responses are authenticated and authorized, even for internal traffic.

### SD-WAN Architecture and Operation

The SD-WAN is managed by a **Controller and management software**, which can be located in the corporate data center or a public cloud.

* **SD-WAN Capable Devices:** Each site (branch, data center) has an SD-WAN capable router, gateway, or VPN application.
* **Controller Orchestration:** The SD-WAN Controller orchestrates connections to networks and clouds enrolled in the SD-WAN.
* **Underlay Network Agnostic:** It utilizes *any available IP underlay network*, such as broadband Internet, 4G/5G cellular, or private MPLS VPNs, to provision the fastest or most reliable available transport.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The Controller also ensures that access requests are authenticated and authorized, reinforcing the security posture.

## Data Center Network Design

A data center is a site dedicated to provisioning server resources. It hosts network services (authentication, addressing, name resolution), application servers, and storage area networks (SANs). While many are purpose-built facilities, some concepts apply to on-premises server rooms.

### Evolution of Data Center Design

* **No Client PCs:** Unlike a corporate network, a data center contains no client PCs, other than hardened, secure administrative workstations (SAWs) used solely to manage servers.
* **Traditional Three-Tiered Design (Legacy):** Historically, data centers were designed using the same three-tiered model as an enterprise campus network, with core, distribution, and access layer switches.
* **Shift to East-West Traffic:** The changing way applications are designed (as services, using virtualization and on-demand instances) has dramatically changed the nature of traffic flows.
    * **North-South Traffic:** Traditional traffic flow between clients and servers, often passing through a central firewall.
    * **East-West Traffic:** Predominant traffic flow **between servers** within the data center (e.g., microservices communicating, virtual machines talking to each other).
* **Security Challenges with East-West Traffic:** The preponderance of East-West traffic complicates security design. If each of these cascading transactions were to pass through a central firewall/security appliance, it would create a severe security bottleneck.
* **Virtualized Security & Zero Trust:** These requirements drive the creation of **virtualized security appliances** that can monitor traffic flowing between servers. Simultaneously, security implementations are moving towards a **Zero Trust design**, implying a highly segmented network where each link between servers must be authenticated and authorized.

### Overlay Networks in Data Centers

* An **overlay network** is used to implement this type of point-to-point logical link between nodes or networks, abstracting the complexity of the underlying physical topology.
* It uses **encapsulation protocols** and **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** to create a logical tunnel between nodes or networks.
* When used inside a data center, overlay networks are commonly implemented using **Virtual eXtensible LANs (VXLANs)**.

---

## INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IaC)

Cloud services require the rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of server instances and networks, relying heavily on automation, orchestration, and the use of overlay networks to establish point-to-point links quickly and reliably.

This means that these infrastructure components must be fully accessible to scripting, representing the idea of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) serves as a model for these processes.

### Automation

* **Automation** via scripting means that each configuration or build task is performed by a block of code.
* The script takes standard arguments as data, reducing uncertainty over configuration choices and leading to fewer errors.
* **Two principal types of automation tools** focus on making a single, discrete task repeatable:
    * **Imperative Tools:** Require the precise steps to follow to achieve the desired configuration as input. This approach is most similar to automating traditional scripting languages such as PowerShell and Bash.
    * **Declarative Tools:** Take the desired configuration as input and leave the details of how that configuration should be achieved to the implementation platform. For example, a declarative configuration file specifies the *desired state*, leaving the specific implementation to the automation platform. Imperative tools specify *each step required*.

### Orchestration

* Where automation focuses on making a single discrete task easily repeatable, **orchestration performs a sequence of automated tasks via scripts or API service calls.**
* For orchestration to work properly, automated steps must occur in the correct sequence, taking dependencies into account. It must provide the right security credentials at every step and have the necessary rights and permissions to perform the defined tasks.
* Orchestration automates complex processes that might otherwise require dozens or hundreds of manual steps.
* Automation and Orchestration platforms connect to provide administration, management, and orchestration for many cloud platforms and services. Industry leaders include **Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and Kubernetes.**

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Defined

* Rather than manually installing operating systems and applications, making configuration changes, or installing patches, cloud technology encourages the use of **scripted approaches to provisioning and infrastructure management**.
* This is where automation and orchestration fully replace manual configuration, referred to as **IaC**.
* One of IaC's goals is to **eliminate "Snowflake Systems."** A Snowflake is a configuration or build that is different from others. The lack of consistency (or drift) in the platform environment leads to security and stability issues.
* **IaC tools for provisioning and management:**
    * **Terraform:** Primarily for **immutable infrastructure provisioning** (creating, modifying, deleting infrastructure resources like VMs, networks, storage).
    * **Ansible:** **Mutable**. Uses Playbooks, Inventory, Templates. Communication via SSH (port 22). Agentless (Push mechanism).
    * **Puppet:** **Mutable**. Uses Manifests, Templates. Communication via HTTPS (REST API) (port 8140 TCP). Agent-based (Pull mechanism).
    * **Chef:** **Mutable**. Uses Recipes, Run-lists. Communication via HTTPS (REST API) (port 10002 TCP). Agent-based (Pull mechanism).

## SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKING (SDN)

SDN is a model for how these IaC processes are used for provisioning and de-provisioning networks.

### SDN Architecture (Three Layers)

SDN architectures are typically divided into three logical layers, from top to bottom: Application, Control (or Management), and Infrastructure (or Data).

1.  **Application Layer (Top):**
    * Applies business logic to make decisions about how traffic should be prioritized, secured, and switched.
    * This layer defines policies such as segmentation, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Security Groups, traffic prioritization, policing/shaping, and QoS.
    * It defines the *desired configuration and network behavior*.

2.  **Control / Management Plane Layer (Middle):**
    * The principal innovation of SDN is to **insert a control layer between the application layer and the infrastructure layer.**
    * The functions of the control plane are implemented by a virtual device known as the **SDN Controller**.
    * The controller interacts programmatically with network devices.
    * **Northbound API (NBI):** The interface between SDN applications and the SDN controller. It allows applications to interact with the controllers, access the data it gathers about the network, program it, and make changes in the network via the Southbound API. Data is often sent in structured/serialized formats like JSON/YAML. It supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    * **Southbound API (SBI):** The interface between the SDN Controller and the infrastructure devices. It allows the controller to communicate with and control the network devices (e.g., modify their data plane tables like IP, ACL, MAC, NAT). OpenFlow is a common Southbound API protocol.
    * A separate **Management Plane** sits at the same level as the Control Plane to interface with the operational layer (e.g., device state, CPU/memory utilization). This is used for adding traffic conditions based on network status.

3.  **Infrastructure / Data Plane Layer (Bottom):**
    * These are the physical or virtual network appliances (switches, routers, firewalls, etc.) that handle the actual **forwarding (data) and operational planes** of traffic.
    * They perform the important tasks of switching and routing traffic.

## Chapter 20: Infrastructure As Code (IaC): Automation & Orchestration 

## Network Automation

Network automation provides many key benefits by using tools and methods to automate tasks.

### Key Benefits of Network Automation

* **Scalability:** Networks become much more scalable as configurations can be deployed rapidly and consistently across many devices.
* **Network-Wide Policy Compliance:** Automated systems ensure that policies are consistently applied across the entire network, reducing configuration drift.
* **Improved Efficiency:** Automating network operations leads to reduced operating expenses (OpEx) by minimizing manual effort and human error.
* **Consistency:** Reduces "Snowflake Systems" and configuration drift, leading to greater stability and security.

### Tools and Methods for Network Automation

* **Ansible, Puppet, Python scripts, Chef:** Common tools used for network automation.
* **REST API:** A common interface used on controllers and network devices for programmatic interaction.
* **SDN Solutions:** Software-Defined Networking greatly facilitates the automation of various tasks via the SDN Controller.
* **Traditional Network Architectures:** Networking tasks can also be automated in traditional network architectures, but SDN tools can provide greater benefits by centralizing control.

## Cisco Sd-Access

Cisco SD-Access is Cisco's enterprise-level SDN solution for campus and branch networks.

### Underlay and Overlay in SD-Access

* **Underlay Network:** The underlying physical network of devices and connections (including wired and wireless) providing Layer 3 IP connectivity. Its purpose is to support the VXLAN tunnels of the Overlay.
* **Overlay Network:** The virtual network built on top of the physical underlay. SD-Access uses **VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible LAN)** to build tunnels over the underlay, providing Layer 2 connectivity over a Layer 3 underlay.
* **Fabric:** The combination of the Underlay and Overlay forms the network fabric.

### Three Different Roles for Switches in SD-Access

1.  **Edge Nodes:**
    * Connect to end-hosts (clients).
    * Access Switches act as the default gateway for end-hosts (implementing a **Routed Access Layer**).
2.  **Border Nodes:**
    * Connect to devices outside of the SD-Access domain (e.g., WAN routers, external data centers, the Internet).
3.  **Control Nodes:**
    * Use **LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol)** to perform various control plane functions.
    * Maintain a list of mappings of **EID (Endpoint Identifiers)** to **RLOCs (Routing Locators)**, effectively separating identity from location.

### SD-Access Deployment Models

* **Brownfield Deployment:** SD-Access can be added to an existing network if your hardware and software support it.
* **Greenfield Deployment:** A new deployment will be configured by **Cisco DNA Center** to ensure an optimal SD-Access underlay.
    * In a Greenfield deployment, all links between switches are **routed ports**.
    * **No Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** is needed in the underlay due to the routed links.
    * Access Switches act as the default gateway for end-hosts.
    * Cisco's **TrustSec (CTS)** provides policy control (QoS, security policy, etc.) within SD-Access.

## Cisco DNA Center

Cisco DNA Center is the SDN Controller for SD-Access and has two main roles:

1.  **Network Manager:** For traditional (non-SD-Access) networks, it provides centralized management, monitoring, and automation capabilities.
2.  **SDN Controller:** For SD-Access deployments.

* **REST API:** DNA Center exposes a REST API that can be used to interact with it programmatically. The Southbound Interface (SBI) supports Netconf and Restconf.
* **Intent-Based Networking:** DNA Center enables "Intent-Based Networking." This allows engineers to communicate their *intent* for network behavior (e.g., "Guest users should not access corporate resources"). DNA Center then translates this intent into the actual configurations and policies on the network devices, centrally managing and monitoring them.
* **Configuration Drift:** DNA Center helps to prevent **configuration drift**, which occurs when individual changes made over time cause a device's configuration to deviate from the standardized or correct configurations defined by the company. It facilitates **Configuration Provisioning**, referring to how configuration changes are applied to devices.
