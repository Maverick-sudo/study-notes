# SQL and SQL Injection

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most common solution for storing and interacting with data in a relational database. A relational database management system (RDBMS) organizes information into one or more tables, which are collections of data organized into rows and columns.

-   **Table**: A collection of data organized into rows and columns, also referred to as a relation.
-   **Column/Field**: A set of data values of a particular type.
-   **Row**: A single record in a table.

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

### CREATE DATABASE
The `CREATE DATABASE` statement is used to create a new SQL database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE databasename;
```

### DROP DATABASE
The `DROP DATABASE` statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

```sql
DROP DATABASE databasename;
```
> **Note**: Be careful before dropping a database. Deleting a database will result in the loss of all information stored in it.

### BACKUP DATABASE
The `BACKUP DATABASE` statement is used in SQL Server to create a full backup of an existing SQL database.

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';
```

A differential backup only backs up the parts of the database that have changed since the last full database backup.

```sql
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL;
```

### CREATE TABLE
The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in a database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
```

You can also create a copy of an existing table. The new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;
```

### ALTER TABLE
The `ALTER TABLE` clause lets you make changes, such as adding a new column to a table.

### DROP TABLE
The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

### TRUNCATE TABLE
The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```

### Constraints
SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table, ensuring accuracy and reliability.

-   **`NOT NULL`**: Ensures that a column cannot have a `NULL` value.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Persons (
        ID int NOT NULL,
        LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        Age int
    );
    ```
-   **`UNIQUE`**: Ensures that all values in a column are different.
-   **`PRIMARY KEY`**: A combination of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`. It uniquely identifies each row in a table. A table can have many `UNIQUE` constraints, but only one `PRIMARY KEY`.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Persons (
        ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
        LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        FirstName varchar(255),
        Age int
    );
    ```
-   **`FOREIGN KEY`**: Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables. It is a field in one table that refers to the `PRIMARY KEY` in another table.
-   **`CHECK`**: Ensures that the values in a column satisfy a specific condition.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Persons (
        ID int NOT NULL,
        LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
        FirstName varchar(255),
        Age int,
        CHECK (Age>=18)
    );
    ```
-   **`DEFAULT`**: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Orders (
        ID int NOT NULL,
        OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
        OrderDate date DEFAULT GETDATE()
    );
    ```
-   **`CREATE INDEX`**: Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly. Indexes are not visible to users but are used to speed up searches.
    ```sql
    -- Allows duplicate values
    CREATE INDEX index_name
    ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

    -- Does not allow duplicate values
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
    ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
    ```

### AUTO_INCREMENT / IDENTITY
The `AUTO_INCREMENT` or `IDENTITY(X,Y)` field allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

### SELECT
The `SELECT` clause is used to query data and retrieve information stored in a database.

### INSERT INTO
The `INSERT INTO` clause adds specified data as a new row or record.

-   Specify both column names and values:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
    ```
-   Add values for all columns (in order):
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
    ```

### INSERT INTO SELECT
The `INSERT INTO SELECT` statement copies data from one table and inserts it into another. Data types in the source and target tables must match.

-   Copy all columns:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table2
    SELECT * FROM table1
    WHERE condition;
    ```
-   Copy specific columns:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO table2 (column1, column2, column3, ...)
    SELECT column1, column2, column3, ... FROM table1
    WHERE condition;
    ```

### UPDATE
The `UPDATE` clause edits existing rows in a table.
```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
> **Note**: Be careful when updating records. If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be updated.

### DELETE
The `DELETE FROM` statement deletes existing rows from a table.
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
> **Note**: If you omit the `WHERE` clause, all records in the table will be deleted, but the table structure, attributes, and indexes will remain intact.

### SELECT INTO
The `SELECT INTO` statement copies data from one table into a new table.
```sql
-- Copy all columns into a new table
SELECT * INTO newtable FROM oldtable WHERE condition;

-- Copy specific columns into a new table
SELECT column1, column2, ... INTO newtable FROM oldtable WHERE condition;

-- Create an empty table based on another table's schema
SELECT * INTO newtable FROM oldtable WHERE 1 = 0;
```

## Query Clauses and Operators

### ALIASES (AS)
SQL aliases give a table or column a temporary name, which can make queries more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of the query.

-   **Column Alias**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;
    ```
-   **Table Alias**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name AS alias_name;
    ```

### UNION & UNION ALL
The `UNION` operator combines the result-set of two or more `SELECT` statements.

-   `UNION`: Selects only distinct values.
-   `UNION ALL`: Allows duplicate values.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```
> **Note**: Both `SELECT` statements must have the same number of columns with similar data types and in the same order.

### JOIN
The `JOIN` clause combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

-   **`INNER JOIN`**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
    ```
-   **`LEFT JOIN`** (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
    ```
-   **`RIGHT JOIN`** (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`): Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
    ```
-   **`FULL OUTER JOIN`**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1 FULL OUTER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
-   **`SELF JOIN`**: A regular join where a table is joined with itself.
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
    WHERE condition;
    ```

### DISTINCT
The `DISTINCT` keyword returns only unique values in the output.

### LIMIT / TOP / ROWNUM
These clauses specify the maximum number of rows to return.

-   **SQL Server / MS Access**:
    ```sql
    SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
-   **MySQL**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;
    ```
-   **Oracle**:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name(s)
    FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;
    ```

### WHERE
The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on a specified condition.

| Operator  | Description        |
| :-------- | :----------------- |
| `=`       | Equal              |
| `>`       | Greater than       |
| `<`       | Less than          |
| `>=`      | Greater than or equal |
| `<=`      | Less than or equal |
| `<>` or `!=`| Not equal          |
| `BETWEEN` | Between a certain range |
| `LIKE`    | Search for a pattern  |
| `IN`      | Specify multiple possible values |

### Wildcards
Wildcard characters are used with the `LIKE` operator to search for a pattern in a string.

**SQL Server Wildcards**

| Symbol | Description                               | Example                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `%`    | Represents zero or more characters        | `bl%` finds `bl`, `black`, `blue`       |
| `_`    | Represents a single character             | `h_t` finds `hot`, `hat`, and `hit`     |
| `[]`   | Represents any single character within brackets | `h[oa]t` finds `hot` and `hat`      |
| `^`    | Represents any character not in the brackets | `h[^oa]t` finds `hit`                   |
| `-`    | Represents a character within a range     | `c[a-b]t` finds `cat` and `cbt`         |

**MS Access Wildcards**

| Symbol | Description                               | Example                                 |
| :----- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `*`    | Represents zero or more characters        | `bl*` finds `bl`, `black`, `blue`       |
| `?`    | Represents a single character             | `h?t` finds `hot`, `hat`, and `hit`     |
| `[]`   | Represents any single character within brackets | `h[oa]t` finds `hot` and `hat`      |
| `!`    | Represents any character not in the brackets | `h[!oa]t` finds `hit`                   |
| `-`    | Represents any single character within a range | `c[a-b]t` finds `cat` and `cbt`         |
| `#`    | Represents any single numeric character   | `2#5` finds `205`, `215`, etc.          |

### Aggregate Functions
Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.

-   `MIN()`: Returns the smallest value in a column.
-   `MAX()`: Returns the largest value in a column.
-   `COUNT()`: Returns the number of rows matching a criterion.
-   `AVG()`: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
-   `SUM()`: Returns the total sum of a numeric column.

### CASE
The `CASE` statement creates different outputs based on conditions, similar to an `if-then-else` statement.

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE result
END;
```

### GROUP BY
The `GROUP BY` statement, often used with aggregate functions, groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It comes after `WHERE` but before `ORDER BY` or `LIMIT`.

```sql
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

### ORDER BY
The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

### HAVING
The `HAVING` clause filters the results of a query based on an aggregate property. It is used because the `WHERE` keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

## Stored Procedures
A stored procedure is prepared SQL code that you can save and reuse. You can pass parameters to a stored procedure to make it more flexible.

-   **Create Procedure**:
    ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
    AS
    sql_statement
    GO;
    ```
-   **Execute Procedure**:
    ```sql
    EXEC procedure_name;
    ```

## Date and Time
The most difficult part of working with dates is ensuring that the format of the date you are inserting matches the date format of the column in the database.

-   **MySQL Date Types**: `DATE` (YYYY-MM-DD), `DATETIME` (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS), `TIMESTAMP`, `YEAR`.
-   **SQL Server Date Types**: `DATE` (YYYY-MM-DD), `DATETIME` (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS), `SMALLDATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`.

## Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns like a real table and always shows up-to-date data.

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

## SQL Injection
A SQL Injection is a common web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By constructing text inputs that modify the backend SQL query, an attacker can force the application to output private data or behave unexpectedly.

Protection techniques include input validation, parameterized queries, stored procedures, and using a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

### SQLmap
SQLmap is an open-source tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws.

```bash
sqlmap -u 'http://{target_IP}/dashboard.php?search=any+query' --cookie="PHPSESSID={Your_cookie}"
```

If the tool confirms a vulnerability, you can use the `--os-shell` flag to attempt command injection.

### Example: Authentication Bypass
Consider the following vulnerable PHP code:
```php
<?php
mysql_connect("localhost", "db_username", "db_password"); // Connection to the SQL Database.
mysql_select_db("users"); // Database table where user information is stored.
$username=$_POST['username']; // User-specified username.
$password=$_POST['password']; //User-specified password.
$sql="SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'"; // Query for user/pass retrieval from the DB.
$result=mysql_query($sql); // Performs query stored in $sql and stores it in $result.
$count=mysql_num_rows($result); // Sets the $count variable to the number of rows stored in $result.
if ($count==1){ // Checks if there's at least 1 result, and if yes:
    $_SESSION['username'] = $username; // Creates a session with the specified $username.
    $_SESSION['password'] = $password; // Creates a session with the specified $password.
    header("location:home.php"); // Redirect to homepage.
}
else { // If there's no singular result of a user/pass combination:
    header("location:login.php");
}
?>
```
This code is vulnerable because it directly embeds user input into the SQL query without validation. An attacker could input `admin'#` as the username. The `#` symbol starts a comment in SQL, so the query becomes:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'# AND password='...'
```
The server executes only the part before the comment, searching for a user named `admin` and ignoring the password check. If a user named `admin` exists, the query returns a result, and the login succeeds.

### Types of SQL Injection
-   **Union-Based Injection**
-   **Error-Based Injection**
-   **Time-Based Injection**
-   **Out-of-Band Injection**
-   **Boolean Injection**
-   **Blind SQL Injection**: Occurs when the application is vulnerable but does not return query results or database errors in its HTTP responses.
-   **Second-order (Stored) SQL Injection**: The application stores malicious user input and later uses it in an unsafe SQL query.

## Connecting to a Database
To communicate with a database, you need a client like `mysql` or `mariadb`.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install mysql*
```
It is essential to test for passwordless authentication, especially during development stages.
```bash
# Attempt to log in as root without a password
mysql -h {target_IP} -u root
```
Common commands after connecting:
-   `SHOW databases;`: Lists accessible databases.
-   `USE {database_name};`: Selects a database to use.
-   `SHOW tables;`: Lists tables in the current database.
-   `SELECT * FROM {table_name};`: Retrieves all data from a table.
