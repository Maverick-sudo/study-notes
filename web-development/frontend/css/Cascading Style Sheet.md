### /*Cascading Style Sheet*/

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
### Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide,

### shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops,

tablets, and phones). variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
### With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between

### elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or

background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
### CSS Comment Syntax /* content */

Cheatsheet(http://www.cheat-sheets.org/sites/css.su/) & (https://overapi.com/css)
### Ruleset/Style Sheet Terms:

Selector—The beginning of the ruleset used to target the element that will be styled.
### Declaration Block—The code in-between (and including) the curly braces

({ }) that contains the CSS declaration(s). Declaration—The group name for a property and value pair that applies a style to the selected element.
### Property—The first part of the declaration that signifies what visual

characteristic of the element is to be modified. Value—The second part of the declaration that signifies the value of the property. All CSS Simple Selectors Universal Selector- * {declaration block} - All Element/ Tag name selector. . Pseudo-class selectors :focus, :visited, :disabled, :hover :active are all pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the DOM can all give elements a different state with pseudo-class. Syntax= p/a/h1/div :hover {declaration block}
Type Selector- p / h1 / div {declaration block} - Affects every content specified by the element block. Multiple Selectors. In order to make CSS more concise, it’s possible to add CSS styles to multiple CSS selectors all at once if they contain same styling values. This prevents writing repetitive code. We can separate the selectors by a comma(,) Class Selector- ︒className {declaration block} - Affects a particular class attribute of an element. You can group classes by attributing a specific class to element likes in HTML, and then styling them uniquely in CSS. Fullstop with HTML class Name{} Chaining. When writing CSS rules, it’s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time. This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. We can separate the selectors by a full- stop(.) ID Selector- #idValue {declaration block} - Affect uniquely an HTML attribute of an element. Descendant Combinator. addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements, also known as descendants. We can separate the selectors by a whitespace( ) Href Selector & Src Selector- Target all elements with an href / src attribute or it can selects an element where the attribute contains any instance of the specified value. Attribute selector use to style html elements that have specific attribute or attribute vales. Specificity is a common reason why your CSS-rules don't apply to some elements, although you think they should. IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, [type]. To make styles easy to edit, it’s best to style with a type selector, if possible. If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector
[href]{declaration block} or a[href*=‘embedLink’]{declaration block} [src]{declaration block} or img[src*=‘value’]{declaration block} Note: Specificity takes priority to Chaining.
### Speciﬁcity Hierarchy

Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.
### There are four categories which deﬁne the speciﬁcity level of a selector:

Inline styles - An inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. Example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">. IDs - An ID is a unique identifier for the page elements, such as #navbar.
### Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes - This category includes .classes,

[attributes] and pseudo-classes such as :hover, :focus etc.
### Elements and pseudo-elements - This category includes element names and

pseudo-elements, such as h1, div, :before and :after. *The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element!
### *The inherit keyword speciﬁes that a property should inherit its value from its

parent element. The inherit keyword can be used for any CSS property, and on any HTML element. All CSS Attribute Selectors Selector Example Example description [attribute] [target] Selects all elements with a target attribute [attribute=value] [target=_blank] Selects all elements with target="_blank"
[attribute~=value] [title~=flower] Selects all elements with a title attribute containing the word "flower" [attribute|=value] [lang|=en] Selects all elements with a lang attribute value starting with "en" [attribute^=value] a[href^="https"] Selects every <a> element whose href attribute value begins with "https" [attribute$=value] a[href$=".pdf"] Selects every <a> element whose href attribute value ends with ".pdf" [attribute*=value] a[href*="w3schools Selects every <a> element whose href attribute value contains the substring "w3schools"
### CSS Colors /Syntax- color:

rgb(red, green, blue) / color:rgb(x, y, z); rgbA(red, green, blue, alpha)/ color:rgb(x, y, z, opacity: 0.0-1.0) HEX
### #rrggbb or #rgb 3-digit type

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness) / color:hsl(a, b, c); hslA(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)/ color:hsla(a, b, c, opacity: 0.0-1.0);
Alpha channels present in background-color contain set values of 0.0-1.0 to set transparency levels. Background Properties Property Description background Sets all the background properties in one declaration background-attachment Sets whether a background image is fixed background- attachment: fixed; or scrolls with the rest of the page background- attachment: scroll; background-clip Specifies the painting area of the background background-color Sets the background color of an element background-image Sets the background image for an element with URL. background- image: url("paper.gif"); background-origin Specifies where the background image(s) is/are positioned background-position Sets the starting position of a background image. background- position: right top; background-repeat Sets how a background image will be repeated vertical or horizontal background- repeat: repeat-y; /  background- repeat: repeat-x; / background- repeat: no-repeat; background-size Specifies the size of the background image(s) Shorthand Background Property Syntax. background: #ffffff url("img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
background-color: #ffffff; background-image: url("img_tree.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat;
### background-position: right top;

CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.
### Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally), direction can be in

angles(deg), The repeating-linear-gradient() function is used to repeat linear gradients: Syntax background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-
### stop2, ...);

Radial Gradients (defined by their center)-To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops. Syntax background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start- color, ..., last-color); All CSS Text Properties Property Description color Sets the color of text direction Specifies the text direction/ writing direction:rtl; unicode-bidi letter-spacing Increases or decreases the space between characters in a text line-height Sets the line height text-align Specifies the horizontal alignment of text: center; left; right; justify text-decoration Specifies the decoration added to text:none; overline; underline; line- through text-indent Specifies the indentation of the first line in a text-block
text-shadow Specifies the shadow effect added to text. In its simplest use, you only specify the horizontal shadow (px) and the vertical shadow (px) with space. Can add color to shadow. text-transform Controls the capitalization of text: uppercase; lowercase; capitalize; text-overflow Specifies how overflowed content that is not displayed should be signaled to the user: clip; ellipsis; unicode-bidi Used together with the direction property to set or return whether the text should be overridden to support multiple languages in the same document vertical-align Sets the vertical alignment of an element: baseline; text-top; text-bottom; sub; super white-space Specifies how white-space inside an element is handled word-spacing Increases or decreases the space between words in a text All CSS Font Properties Property Description
font Shorthand syntax Use Sets all the font properties in one declaration {family style size weight} font-family Specifies the font family for text font-size Specifies the font size of text font-style Specifies the font style for text. Normal, italic or oblique; font-variant Specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small- caps font font-weight Specifies the boldness of a font
### CSS @font-face Rule

Web fonts allow Web designers to use fonts that are not installed on the user's computer.
### Google Fonts provides free fonts that can be used in an HTML ﬁle with

the <link> tag or the @font-face property.
### Downloaded Local fonts can be added to a .CSS document with the @font-

### face property ruleset and the path to the font’s source in this syntax. With

format verifying the file type downloaded.
### @font-face {

font-family: ‘myFont'; src: url(‘path’of’downloaded’font’) format('woff2’);
### Deﬁned a name for the font e.g myFont, and then point to the font ﬁle source,

include font format (‘woff2’), most commonly supported by all major browsers. Whilst using bold text, you must add another @font-face rule containing descriptors for bold text.
### The four links states are:

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules: Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).
### What are Pseudo-classes?A pseudo-class is used to deﬁne a special state of

### an element. Example it can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over

### it, Style visited and unvisited links differently, Style an element when it gets

### focus.  CSS Syntax selector :pseudo-class {}

What are Pseudo-Elements? A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. Example, it can be used to: Style the first letter, or line, of an element, Insert content before, or after, the content of an element. CSS Syntax selector ::pseudo- element {}
a:link - a normal, unvisited link Syntax a:link/visited/hover/ active {declaration} a:visited - a link the user has visited Multiple Syntax can be declared with comma operator to separate. a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
### Transparent Hover Effect

### The opacity property is often used together with

### the :hover selector to change the opacity on mouse-over. The opacity property

### can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:

### img {opacity: 0.5;} Makes the image 50% transparent

img:hover {opacity: 1.0;} declare to make the image clear. Non-tansparent. All CSS List Properties for <ol> & <ul> Property Description list-style: type position image; Sets all the properties for a list in one declaration list-style-image: url(‘xyz.gif/jpg’) Specifies an image as the list-item marker list-style-position: inside/ outside; Specifies the position of the list-item markers (bullet points) list-style-type: circle/ square/upper-roman/lower- alpha; Specifies the type of list-
### item marker

CSS Table Properties for <table> <th> <td> Property Description border Sets all the border properties in one declaration
border-collapse Specifies whether or not table borders should be collapsed border-spacing Specifies the distance between the borders of adjacent cells caption-side Specifies the placement of a table caption empty-cells Specifies whether or not to display borders and background on empty cells in a table table-layout Sets the layout algorithm to be used for a table Overflow Property The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both). overflow: visible; when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value ⇔overflow: hidden; when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view. Parent Element containing children element can have overflow values of overflow: inherit; overflow: initial; overflow: revert; overflow: unset; overflow: scroll; when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling. overflow: clip; overflow: auto; overflow: hidden visible; CSS Outline
Property Description outline An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out". With properties style, color, width, offset.
## Shorthand Property——>

Outline: width style color; outline-color Sets the color of an outline outline-offset Specifies the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element outline-style Sets the style of an outline outline-width
### Sets the width of an outline

Display property:—> inline, block, and inline-block.
### Such as <em>, <strong>, <span>, <img> and <a>, is called inline by default,

Inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties.
### Elements that are block-level by default include all levels of heading elements

(<h1> through <h6>), <li>, <p>, <div>, <form>, <header>, <section> and <footer>. <img> are the best example of default inline-block elements. However we can make adjusted to this elements using this declaration in respective element selector
### {display: inline;}

### The CSS display property provides the ability to make any

element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default.
### {display: block;}

The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element a block element.
### {display: inline-block}

### Inline-block display combines features of both inline and

### block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can

### specify their dimensions using the width and height properties, the top and

### bottom margins/paddings are respected. Compared to display: block; the major

### difference is that display: inline-block; does not add a line-break after the

### element, so the element can sit next to other elements. One common use for

display: inline-block is to display list items horizontally instead of vertically. The following example creates horizontal navigation links:
### {display: visibility}

Specifies whether or not an element should be visible
### 𝟏 Display & Positioning Property CONTENT-BOX MODEL

All elements on a web page are interpreted by the browser as “living” inside of a
### box. This is what is meant by the box model. The content box model allows us to

add a border around elements, and to define space between elements living in a one-dimensional layout.
Content/element - The content of the box, where text and images appear CSS Setting Content/Element height and width The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element. The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element. The height and width properties may have the following values: auto - This is default. The browser calculates the height and width & length - Defines the height/width in px, cm etc. & % - Defines the height/width in percent of the containing block & initial - Sets the height/width to its default value & inherit - The height/width will be inherited from its parent value NOTE: Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows. Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent CSS Padding The CSS padding properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders. padding- top: & padding-right: & padding- bottom: & padding-left:
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent CSS Margins The CSS margin properties are used to create space around elements, outside of defined borders. margin-top: & margin- right: & margin-bottom: & margin-left: ⚈ auto - the browser calculates the margin ⚈ length - specifies a margin in px, pt, cm, etc. ⚈ % - specifies a margin in % of the width of the containing element ⚈ inherit - specifies that the margin should be inherited from the parent element. Border - A border that goes around the padding and content {border-style: dotted/dashed/ double/groove/ridge/inset/ outset/hidden/;}border-width: (in px, pt, cm, em, etc); or thin, medium, or thick; & border-color:(colors, rgb values, #hex, hsl values etc) SHORTHAND SYNTAX
### {width/lengthPX:…; border:….: padding:…; margin:…;}

### SYNTAX margin: value(auto, length in px,);

SYNTAX padding: value(auto, length in px,); SYNTAX border: width style color;
### ﬂoat & clear property

### Used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image ﬂoat left to the

### text in a container. In its simplest use, the ﬂoat property can be used to wrap

### text around images. When we use the ﬂoat property, and we want the next

element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.
### The ﬂoat/clear property can have one of the following values:

left - The element floats to the left of its container/The element is pushed below
### left ﬂoated elements

right - The element floats to the right of its container/The element is pushed
### below right ﬂoated elements

### none - The element does not ﬂoat (will be displayed just where it occurs in the

text). This is default float./The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default clear. inherit - The element inherits the float/clear value of its parent element.
### We can use display properties to set Navigation bars vertically or horizontally

using inline or float to create Horizontal navigation bar, & Block to create Vertical navigation bar.
### 𝟐  Display & Positioning Property:—> Flexbox Model

The Content-box model However has a limitation as most browsers use a default dimensional value for sizing. NOTE
### TO solve this limitation , border-box model/ﬂexbox is not affected by

### border thickness or padding as with content-box model. However both Content-

Box Model & FlexBox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-dimensional layout This syntax * {box-sizing: border-box;} we insert before body{} element.
### simpliﬁes how to position elements. Box-sizing property allows us to include the

padding and border in an element's total width and height.
### There are two important components to a ﬂexbox layout: ﬂex containers and ﬂex

items. A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items. Flex containers are helpful tools for creating websites that respond to changes in screen sizes. To designate an element as a flex container, set the element’s display properties to either flex or inline-flex.
### {display: ﬂex;}

changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
### {display: inline-ﬂex;}

allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
### Flexbox is an art and a science; you can use it to make laying out multiple

### elements a piece of cake. Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by

declaring {display: flex ;}/ {display: inline-flex;} for children of flex containers. There are two axes in a layout — the column (or block) axis and the row (or inline) axis. Shorthand Syntax {flex:  flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;} in one declaration. Shorthand Syntax {flex-flow: flex-wrap flex-direction;} in one declaration.
display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it. flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis. display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other. flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink. justify-content is used to space items along the main axis. flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough. align-items is used to space items along the cross axis. align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis(rows). flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis. flex-direction is used to specify the main(columns) and cross axis(rows).
### Display & Positioning Property:—> CSS Grids

### Content-Box Model & FlexBox is mostly useful for positioning items in a one-

dimensional layout, CSS grid is most useful for two-dimensional layouts, providing
### many tools for aligning and moving elements across both rows and columns. A grid

layout consists of a parent element, with one or more child elements
### To set up a

### grid, you need to have both a grid container and grid items. The CSS Grid Layout

### Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it

easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning. To turn an HTML element into a grid container, you must set the element’s display property to one of two values:{display: grid;} for a block-level grid. {display: inline-grid;} for an inline grid. justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
Rows are defined as a percentage of the grid’s height, and columns are defined as a percentage of its width. By default grids contain one columns, to add more we use the syntax below. Likewise for rows.{grid-template-columns: px/%value px%value;} {grid- template-rows: px/%value px/ %value;} Shorthand Syntax
### {grid-template: px/% Rows / px/

% columns;} To prevent irregular shrinking/ enlargement of grids due to browser size specifications, we can set a minimax to prevent rows & columns from getting too big or too small. Don’t use fraction. Syntax: {grid-template- rows or grid-template-columns: 10px minmax(10px, 20px) 50px;} justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
NOTE:percentages (%), px, ems and rems. CSS Grid introduced a new relative sizing unit — fr, fraction of the grid’s length and width Using fr makes it easier to prevent grid items from overflowing the boundaries of the grid. Consider the syntax {grid-template: 2fr 1fr 1fr / 1fr 3fr 1fr;}. Note: The repeat function will duplicate the specifications for rows or columns a given number of times, a relationship where grid property takes function as a value. Syntax {grid-template- columns/rows: repeat(X, fr); it will duplicate the designated fractional rates by number X times. We can apply this to grid-template. justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis The CSS properties grid-row- gap: and grid-column-gap: will put blank space between every row and column in the grid. It is important to note that grid gap properties does not add space at the beginning or end of the grid. Unlike other CSS grid properties, this shorthand does not take a / between values! If only one value is given, it will set the column gap & the row gap to that value. Syntax will be {grid- gap: row-gap-px column-gap- px;} align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
To enable elements sitting inside the grid take more than 1row/column, using {grid-row/ column-start: or grid-row/ column-end:}. The value for start should be the row at which you want the grid item to begin. The value for end should be one greater(+1) than the row at which you want the grid item to end. Shorthand Syntax {grid- row or column: start/ end;} We can use the word span when specifying grid row/columns end to avoid miscalculating the ending grid line. For instance, we want row/columns to span 1/2/3 rows we specify it in our syntax. Note {grid-area: grid-row-start(w) / grid-column- start(x) / grid-row-end(y) / grid- column-end(z);} or {grid-area: w / x / y / z;} align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
Grid Template Areas The grid-template-areas property allows you to name sections of your web page to use as values in the grid-row-start, grid-row- end, grid-column-start,grid- column-end, and grid-area properties. This property is declared on grid containers. {grid-template-areas: ⇔”rows” ↕”columns”;
⇔”rows1” ↕”columns1”;
⇔”rows2” ↕”columns2”;} Also declare their grid-area in their respective class declaration block. {grid-area: row1;} Either in header, nav, footer, etc. align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
## Implicit & Explicit Grids

The implicit grid is an algorithm built into the specification for CSS Grid that determines default behavior for the placement of elements when there are more than fit into the grid specified by the CSS. CSS Grid provides two properties to specify the size of grid tracks added implicitly: grid-auto-rows and grid- auto-columns. These properties are declared on grid containers. Explicit Grid / Auto Flow addition to setting the dimensions of implicitly-added rows and columns, we can specify the order in which they are rendered. grid-auto-rows: specifies the height of implicitly added grid rows. grid- auto-columns: specifies the width of implicitly added grid columns. grid-auto-flow: specifies whether new elements should be added to rows or columns, and is declared on grid containers.
grid-auto-rows & grid-auto-columns accept the unit of values as their explicit counterparts, grid-template- rows and grid-template-columns: pixels (px)/ percentages (%)/ fractions (fr) /the repeat() function. grid-auto-flow accepts these values: row; — specifies the new elements should fill rows from left to right and create new rows when there are too many elements (default) column; — specifies the new elements should fill columns from top to bottom and create new columns when there are too many elements dense; — this keyword invokes an algorithm that attempts to fill holes earlier in the grid layout if smaller elements are added You can pair row or column with dense, like this: grid-auto-flow: row dense
### All CSS Positioning Properties

An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always
### positioned according to the normal ﬂow of the page. An element with position:

relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. An element with position:
### ﬁxed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the

### same place even if the page is scrolled. An element with position: absolute; is

### positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned

relative to the viewport, like fixed). An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position. Property Description {position: static/relative/ fixed/absolute/sticky;} Specifies the type of positioning for an element bottom/left/right/top Sets the bottom/left/right/ top margin edge for a positioned box clip Clips an absolutely positioned element
z-index: x/-y(integer); When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).Sets the stack order
### of an element

### CSS transitions allow us to control the timing of visual state changes. We can

control the following four aspects of an element’s transition:
### Which CSS (properties) transition

### To declare which property transitions we use

this syntax {transition-property: property(color/background-color/font-size, etc);} How long a transition lasts(Duration)
### After declaring transition on a property

we can declare {transition-duration: s;} in seconds or milliseconds. How much time there is before a transition begins(Delay)
### Delay speciﬁes the

time to wait before starting the transition.{transition-delay: s;} in seconds or milliseconds. How a transition accelerates?
### {transition-timing-function: ease-in / ease-

out / ease-in-out / linear;}. The timing function describes the pace of the transition. The default value is ease, which starts the transition slowly, speeds up in the middle, and slows down again at the end. Shorthand Syntax
### {transition: property duration timing-function delay;}

To clean up your work since multiple declaration of transition properties might be messy. We can use the shorthand syntax and a comma operator for separate properties.
### Such as {transition: color duration timing-function delay, background-color

### duration timing-function delay, font-size duration timing-function delay;} This

“chaining” is a powerful tool for expressing complicated animations. Even with the shorthand, specifying transitions for many properties can be tedious. It is common to use the same duration, timing function, and delay for multiple properties. When this is the case you can set the transition-property value to all. This will apply
the same values to all properties. To effect this, you can use all as a value for transition-property.
### all means every value that changes will be transitioned in the same way. You can

### use all with the separate transition properties, or the shorthand syntax. This

### allows you to describe the transition of many properties with a single line:

Responsive design refers to the ability of a website to resize and reorganize its
### content based on:The size of other content on the website & The size of the

### screen the website is being viewed on.  Relative measurements offer an

### advantage over hard coded measurements(pixels), as they allow for the

proportions of a website to remain intact regardless of screen size or layout. Relative Units & What elements they apply too. To size text based HTML elements.
### The em however represents the font-size of the current element in relation to

the default base font-size set by the browser if none is given. i.e 1em = 16px(most browsers default font size).
### The rem stands for root em,  it works similarly to em, however its measured

### related to the root element—>the <html> tag with syntax. html {font-size: rem;}

If you are interested in sizing elements consistently across an entire website, the
### rem measurement is the best unit for the job. If you’re interested in sizing

elements in comparison to other elements nearby, then the em unit would be better suited for the job. To size non-text HTML elements.
### Percentages are often used to size box-model values, like width and height,

### padding, border, and margins are sized relative to the dimensions their parent

element(container). They can also be used to set positioning properties (top,
### bottom, left, right). Note: Because the box model includes (padding + borders +

### margins) as total content width & height, setting an element’s width to 100% may

### cause content to overﬂow its parent container. While tempting, 100% should only

be used when element content will not have padding, border, or margin.
### Note: When the height of an image or video is set, then its width can be set to

### auto so that the media scales proportionally. Reversing these two properties and

values will also achieve the same result.
### A background image of an HTML element will scale proportionally when its

background-size property is set to cover. What is The Viewport? The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than
on a computer screen. Setting The Viewport
### HTML5 introduced a method to let

### web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag. You should

### include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

### <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
### The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-

width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
### Responsive Web design

CSS uses media queries to adapt a website’s content to different screen sizes.
### With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply

### different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen.   Media queries can

### set rules based on features like the screen width, the screen resolution and

device orientation. Media query syntax. The declaration block containing rules can be from any CSS element ruleset in your programming. @media only screen and (max-width: 480px) body {font-size: 12px;}
### This syntax (@media) instructs the CSS compiler which type of devices (only

### screen) with (max-width 480px) to apply the CSS styles to devices with a width

of 480 pixels or smaller. CSS rules(body) are nested inside the media query curly
### brackets. The rule is element & declaration block you want to be applied for

screen type 480px nd lower. We can also add ranges for screen sizes height(both minimum and maximum px values).
### @media only screen and (min-width: px) and (max-width: px) {}

### @media only screen and (min-height: px) and (max-height: px) {}

Many times we will want to supply higher quality media (images, video, etc.) only
### to users with screens that can support high resolution media. Targeting screen

### resolution also helps users avoid downloading high resolution (large ﬁle size)

images that their screen may not be able to properly display. @media only screen and (min-resolution: dpi) and (max-resolution: dpi)
### {background-image {}}

### The rule can be applied to background image, or videos sources. Min and max-

resolutions can be supplied. This code will exchange the existing image/video with
a higher/lower resolution logo. We can use the and* operator to chain multiple media features.
### @media only screen and (min/max-width/height: px) and (min/max-resolution:

dpi) {declare multiple element content ruleset corresponding to media queries}
### If only one of multiple media features in a media query must be met, media

features can be separated in a comma separated list.
### Note: The orientation media feature detects if the page has more width than

height. If a page is wider, it’s considered landscape, and if a page is taller, it’s considered portrait.
### @media only screen and (orientation: landscape/portrait) {declare element

content ruleset corresponding to media queries}
## Css Variables

Variables allow information to be maintained and referenced in multiple locations.
### CSS has variables in its own style—more speciﬁcally, they are called Custom

Properties. These variables can be used to hold specific values that can be reused
### throughout the stylesheet. When we deﬁne variables in place of hardcoded

properties, the variable does not immediately take the place of that property’s value until we call that variable.
### Syntax for declaring variables in CSS must begin with a double hyphen (--)

### followed by the variable name, good practice to avoid using capital letters in

### variable names, it is also common to use single hyphen in between for multiple

strings. element{--name: diablo;} , element{—my-name: diablo;}.
### By using variables alongside media queries, we can dynamically change styles

### according to changes in viewport size and general system preference, When using

media queries with CSS variables, the main point of note is that we just need to
redefine variable values for the effect to take place. Variables must be used as an argument inside of the var() function. h1 { --main-background-color: #DADECC; background-color: var(--main-background-color);
### /*declared a variable & assigned it to #HEX color values*/

### /* it replaces value of property in declaration{} using var

Variables are subject to both scope and inheritance. Globally scoped variables are defined inside the :root{} pseudo-class. Locally scoped variables are defined inside the desired selector ruleset. Overriding a variable is done by redefining that variable’s value inside of the desired selector ruleset. Fallback values can be used to provide a backup value if the initial variable is invalid. Multiple fallback values can be provided by adding more values inside cascading var() functions.
### body {background: var(--main-background-color, #F3F3F3);}

/* #F3F3F3 is fallback value, if —main-background-color is invalid*/ body { font-color: var(--main-color, var(--favorite-orange, red)); /* --favorite-orange if --main-color is invalid and red if --favorite-orange is invalid */
## Css Functions

### CSS functions—are blocks of organized and reusable code that help to perform a

### single, related action. Functions have the beneﬁt of keeping code modular and

allowing for a high degree of reusability. However they are limited. url(), var(), repeat(), min(), max(), calc(), clamp(). Some CSS functions are used specifically for certain properties i.e Color Functions rgb(), rgba(), hsl(), hsla(). To use a function in CSS, follow the standard functional notation syntax: h1 { property: function-name(argument);
### The calc() function can be used to perform mathematical operations on a mix of

units (rem, vw, px, etc). When performing addition (+) or subtraction (-), both
### numbers being operated on must have speciﬁed units. Division (/) requires the

divisor (second operand) to be a unit-less number, and multiplication (*) requires
### one of the operands to be unit-less. The function can also be used as one of the

multiple values for a property or argument in another function. Ex {margin: calc(1.5vw + 5px);}
### The min() function will select the smallest value from a range of values and set

that as the associated property’s value. The max() function will select the largest value from a range of values, which will be used as the associated property’s value. The clamp() function enables a specified value to be kept within an upper and lower bound.
### The clamp(x, y, z) function takes three parameters in a speciﬁc order:

### The ﬁrst argument speciﬁes the minimum value(x). If the preferred value(second

### argument), is less than this value, then the minimum value will be used. The

second argument specifies the preferred value(y). This value is used as long as it
### is greater than the value of the ﬁrst argument (lower bound) and less than the

### value of the third argument (upper bound). The third argument speciﬁes the

maximum value(y). This value is the largest value that the property will be set to. The Filter Function, are specifically for the filter & backdrop-filter properties.
### These functions create a variety of visual effects for desired elements with

properties values such as brightness(), blur(), saturate(), drop-shadow(offset-x
### offset-y blur-radius color)

### Both offset-x and offset-y are required arguments

that determine the horizontal and vertical offset respectively. While blur-radius
### is an optional argument that determines the shadow’s blur radius—the larger the

### value, the more blurred the shadow. Finally, the color argument is also optional

### and determines the shadow’s color. Notice that it is not necessary to separate

### each of the function’s arguments with commas etc

### Transform Functions-We can transform any HTML element using the transform

### property combined with CSS functions that scale(x-axis, y-axis), rotate(︒deg),

translate(x-axisPX, y-axisPX) and skew(x-angle,y-angle). These functions apply both 2D transformations to elements. The matrix() method combines all the 2D transform methods into one.
### The matrix() method take six parameters, containing mathematic functions, which

allows you to rotate, scale, move (translate), and skew elements. Syntax matrix(scaleX(),skewY(),skewX(),scaleY(),translateX(),translateY()); Check CSS references for list of 3D transformation functions.
Introduction to Web Accessibility Properties Recommendation font-size a minimum size between 18 to 20 pixels is recommended for smaller screen sizes. Line height/spacing between lines of text. recommend a minimum of 1.5 within paragraphs. Text alignment and paragraph width It is recommended to have 45 to 85 characters per line, with the ideal being suggested as 65 characters. Visual Readability: Color The solution to this is to provide adequate contrast between foreground and background elements https://www.google.com/ chrome/canary/ Contextual Readability: Interactivity Using <abbr> to make full information provided. Hovering over the text contained in this element will display an alternative name for the user. Underlining links is another way to provide clarity. Use of interactive elements such as button with cursor property indicating potential interactivity. Contextual Readability: Color Color can also be used as a contextual indicator of intent or meaning, indication of success and error states. Visibility Hiding content from everyone, hiding content from screen readers, & hiding content from both. Design Reflecting Structure An important consideration when applying CSS to a page is the relationship that the CSS stylesheet has with the HTML document’s underlying structure.
Accessibility Across Mediums. @media screen{} vs @media print{} considering the other ways in which users can consume the content of your web page. For example, how does the page look when printed? The print query syntax can be used to remove element such as <nav> reducing clutter when printed. Or to display values of elements otherwise couldn’t be understood such as links.
### Browser Compatibility

### The ability for a website to be rendered in the same

way across all available modern browsers. The availability of CSS features differs
### across browsers and their versions. Using a CSS property supported only on

select browsers will create inconsistent experiences for users. Thankfully, there are tools such as caniuse.com that can help you find out what browsers support a particular CSS feature.
### Browsers are based on browser engines—the core component responsible for

### rendering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the browser. For example, Chrome, Opera,

### and Edge use Blink as their browser engine, whereas Firefox uses Gecko and

### Safari uses Webkit. Each of these engines renders features such as margins,

padding, colors, or text slightly differently. This is because different browsers
### have different default styles. We can use tools such as browserdefaultstyles.com

### to compare default styles across browsers. There are also tools that we can use,

such as normalize.css and minireset.css, to eliminate differences between browser default styles and ensure that all elements are rendered the same way across browsers.
### Vendor preﬁxes are preﬁxes for property names that were developed as a way

of testing new CSS features or standards before browsers fully supported them.
### These preﬁxes were never intended to be used on production websites, but they

### are sometimes required to use certain new and cutting-edge features or to

support older versions of browsers when those features were cutting edge.
### Rather than looking through every CSS feature on your site to determine which

### features require vendor preﬁxes, you can also use tools such as https://

github.com/postcss/autoprefixer to automatically include all vendor prefixes for the features that require them.
### Polyﬁlls are JavaScript codes that allow older browsers to behave as though

### they understand more advanced features than they actually do. These codes

### rewrite the HTML and CSS codes to simulate features that have not yet been

### adopted by that version of the browser. For a more comprehensive solution, we

can use tools such as https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr or https://
github.com/financial-times/polyfill-service to automatically identify and provide all of the polyfills that our website might need, ensuring that it can run as smoothly as possible on older browsers.
### /*BootStrap*/

### Bootstrap is a framework of readily available code that integrates with HTML

to create stylized websites that adapt the layout to users’ screen sizes.
### Bootstrap simplifies the layout of a website using a grid system. This

### framework allows us to cut down on the time needed to style a website,

### simplifies the complexity of how to layout elements, works across multiple

### browsers, and reduces the frustration of using plain CSS. Using the Bootstrap

grid also allows for responsive design, in other words, a website’s layout can change based on the user’s screen size.
### All it takes to use Bootstrap is a few additional lines in our HTML document. To

### incorporate Bootstrap into a project, the Bootstrap CSS library for styling &

layout. Use Content Delivery Network (CDN).

### ScreenWidth & Small Prefix

xs (<=576px), sm (>=576px), md (>=768px), lg (>=992px) or xl (>=1200px) Sizing utilities class Xs-extraSmall Sm-small Md-medium Lg-large
### Xl-extraLarge

Set the width of an element with the w-* classes
### (.w-25, .w-50, .w-75, .w-100, .mw-100) &

Set the height of an element with the h-* classes
### (.h-25, .h-50, .h-75, .h-100, .mh-100)

### The classes are used in the format: {property}{sides}-{size} for xs and

{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size} for sm, md, lg, and xl. Where property is one of: m - sets margin p - sets padding Where sides is one of: t - sets margin-top or padding-top b - sets margin-bottom or padding-bottom l - sets margin-left or padding-left
### r - sets margin-right or padding-right

### x - sets both padding-left and padding-right or margin-left and margin-right

### y - sets both padding-top and padding-bottom or margin-top and margin-bottom

blank - sets a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element Where size is one of:
### 0 - sets margin or padding to 0

### 1 - sets margin or padding to .25rem (4px if font-size is 16px)

### 2 - sets margin or padding to .5rem (8px if font-size is 16px)

### 3 - sets margin or padding to 1rem (16px if font-size is 16px)

### 4 - sets margin or padding to 1.5rem (24px if font-size is 16px)

5 - sets margin or padding to 3rem (48px if font-size is 16px) auto - sets margin to auto
### margins can also be negative, by adding an "n" in front of size:

### n1 - sets margin to -.25rem (-4px if font-size is 16px)

### n2 - sets margin to -.5rem (-8px if font-size is 16px)

### n3 - sets margin to -1rem (-16px if font-size is 16px)

### n4 - sets margin to -1.5rem (-24px if font-size is 16px)

### n5 - sets margin to -3rem (-48px if font-size is 16px)

Classes ref(https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/
### bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp)

Bootstrap uses classes to apply CSS rulesets — these rulesets dictate the layout and styling of the <element>.
### The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container

The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.
### The max-width of the container will change on different screen sizes/

### viewports. Or A jumbotron indicates a big grey box for calling extra attention

### to some special content or information, Use a <div> element with

class .jumbotron to create a jumbotron, full-width Jumbotron with
### class .jumbotron-fluid

### Bootstrap 4 styles HTML headings (<h1> to <h6>)  with a bolder font-weight and

### an increased font-size using display classes

(.display-1, .display-2, .display-3, .display-4), Display headings are used to stand out more than normal headings (larger font-size and lighter font-weight), and there are four classes to choose from. Bootstrap 4 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".
### The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-

### success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary, .text-

white, .text-dark, .text-body (default body color/often black) and .text- light.
### Block Elements

### To make an element into a block element, add the .d-block class. Use any of the

### d-*-block classes to control WHEN the element should be a block element on a

specific screen width(I.e * = sm,md,lg,xl) .d-inline-block
### Makes an element inline block

### The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-

info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.
### Note that background colors do not set the text color, so in some cases you'll

want to use them together with a .text-* class.
### <img> classes include

### .rounded, .rounded-circle, .img-thumbnail, We can align images to left/

right using .float-left/.float-right class. Or centered aligned images with .mx- auto (margin:auto) & .d-block
### (display:block)

Images come in all sizes. So do screens. Responsive images automatically adjust to fit the size of the screen.
### Create responsive images by adding an .img-fluid class to the <img> tag. The

image will then scale nicely to the parent element. The .img-fluid class applies max-width: 100%; and height: auto; to the image.
### Alerts are created with the .alert class, followed by one of the contextual

### classes .alert-success, .alert-info, .alert-warning, .alert-danger, .alert-

### primary, .alert-secondary, .alert-light or .alert-dark.  You may add alert-

### link class to any links inside the alert box to create “matching colored links”

### To close the alert message, add a .alert-dismissible class to the alert parent

### container. Then add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a button

child element (when you click on this the alert box will disappear).
### Bootstrap provides different styles of buttons with colors. The button

classes can be used on <a>, <button>,<input> elements.
### Buttons are creates with the .btn class, followed by any one of conceptual

classes for sizes, color, active/disabled states.
### Use the .btn-lg class for large buttons or .btn-sm class for small buttons. Add

class .btn-block to create a block level button that spans the entire width of the parent element.
### class="btn btn-primary btn-lg” / class="btn btn-primary active"

### Bootstrap 4 allows you to group a series of buttons together (on a single line)

### in a button group, Use a <div> element with class .btn-group to create a button

### group, Use the class .btn-group-vertical to create a vertical button group

### Badges are used to add additional information to any content. Use the .badge

### class together with a contextual class .badge-* (I.e .badge-secondary) within

### <span> elements to create rectangular badges with color. Note that badges scale

to match the size of the parent element (if any), Use the .badge-pill class to
### make the badges more round

### To create a spinner/loader, use the .spinner-border class, use text color

### utilities to add color to the spinner. .spinner-grow class if you want the

spinner/loader to grow instead of spin. Use .spinner-border-sm or .spinner- grow-sm to create a smaller spinner
To create a basic pagination, add the .pagination class to an <ul> element.
### Then add the .page-item to each <li> element, for redirect link add a  .page-

link class to each link <a> tag inside <li>
### Basic List Groups

### The most basic list group is an unordered list with list items:

To create a basic list group, use an <ul> element with class .list-group, and <li>
### elements with class .list-group-item Use the .active class to highlight the

### current item……If you want the list items to display horizontally instead of

### vertically (side by side instead of on top of each other), add the .list-group-

### horizontal class to .list-group….The classes for coloring list-items are: .list-

### group-item-success, list-group-item-secondary, list-group-item-info, list-

### group-item-warning, .list-group-item-danger, .list-group-item-primary,

### list-group-item-dark and list-group-item-light

### A dropdown menu is a toggleable menu that allows the user to choose one

value from a predefined list, The .dropdown class indicates a dropdown menu.
### To open the dropdown menu, use a button or a link with a class of .dropdown-

toggle and the data-toggle="dropdown" attribute.
### ⎋(https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_ref_js_dropdown.asp)

### Add the .dropdown-menu class to a <div> element to actually build the dropdown

menu. Then add the .dropdown-item class to each element (links or buttons) inside the dropdown menu.
### The .dropdown-divider class is used to separate links inside the dropdown menu

with a thin horizontal border. They also come with .active & .disabled classes. To position
### <div class="dropdown">

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary dropdown-toggle" data- toggle="dropdown"> Dropdown button </button>
### <div class="dropdown-menu">

### <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Link 1</a>

### <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Link 2</a>

<a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Link 3</a> </div> </div>
### Collapsibles are useful when you want to hide and show large amount of

### content, By default, the collapsible content is hidden. However, you can add

### the .show class to show the content by default. ⎋(https://www.w3schools.com/

bootstrap4/bootstrap_ref_js_collapse.asp)
Nav Menus
### If you want to create a simple horizontal menu, add the .nav

class to a <ul> element, followed by .nav-item for each <li> and add the .nav-link class to their links <a> tags.
### Add the .justify-content-center class to center the nav, and the .justify-

### content-end class to right-align the nav. Left-align is default…. For Vertical

### Nav Menus use .nav flex-column class on parent <ul> tags….. Turning Nav menu

### into Navigation tabs with a contextual class of .nav-tabs…  .nav-pills class if

### you want pilled shaped nav tabs. Justify the tabs/pills with the .nav-justified

### class (equal width), also add .dropdown-menu class to tabs. When using

the .navbar-brand class on images, Bootstrap 4 will automatically style the image to fit the navbar vertically.
### The navigation bar can also be fixed at the top or at the bottom of the page. A

fixed navigation bar stays visible in a fixed position (top or bottom) independent
### of the page scroll. The .fixed-top class makes the navigation bar fixed at the

### top inverse for .fixed-bottom class. Use the .sticky-top class to make the

navbar fixed/stay at the top of the page when you scroll past it.
### Bootstrap  Forms

### Form controls automatically receive some global styling

### with Bootstrap: All textual <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements with

class .form-control have a width of 100%. Bootstrap provides two types of
### form layouts:

Stacked (full-width) with class .form-group, around each form control, to ensure proper margins.
### Inline form a wrapper element with class .form-inline…However inline forms

are compressed and will look much better with spacing utilities. You can use different validation classes to provide valuable feedback to users.
### Add either .was-validated or .needs-validation to the <form> element,

### depending on whether you want to provide validation feedback before or after

### submitting the form. The input fields will have a green (valid) or red (invalid)

### border to indicate what's missing in the form. You can also add a .valid-

### feedback or .invalid-feedback message to tell the user explicitly what's

### missing, or needs to be done before submitting the form

The .input-group class is a container to enhance an input by adding an icon, text or a button in front or behind the input field as a "help text".
### Use .input-group-prepend to add the help text in front of the input,

and .input-group-append to add it behind the input. At last, add the .input-group-text class to style the specified help text
### Visibility

### Use the .visible /.invisible classes to control the visibility of

### elements. Note: These classes do not change the CSS display value. They only

add visibility:visible or visibility:hidden
### Screenreaders

Use the .sr-only class to hide an element on all devices,
except screen readers:
### Bootstrap Carousel

The Carousel is a slideshow for cycling through elements mostly images & profiles Flexbox
### The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap

### 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box

### Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure

### without using float or positioning. To create a flexbox container and to

### transform direct children into flex items, use the .d-flex class or To create an

### inline flexbox container, use the d-inline-flex class. Use .flex-column to

### display the flex items vertically (on top of each other), or .flex-column-

reverse to reverse the vertical direction, default is horizontal. We can Justify….Grow…Shrink….Wrap…Align….
### Grid System

Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.
### At the heart of it, containers are the basis of Bootstrap’s grid. Inside

### containers, we nest rows as immediate children. Then, nested inside rows are

columns. Inside columns, we put our actual content. Take a look below at an example of this nesting pattern. <div class="container"> <div class="row">
### <div class="col">

<!-- A column inside a row inside a container! --> </div> </div> </div>
### We can gain even more control of our layout once we start nesting rows inside

columns and setting widths for our columns! But, first, let’s review how to create a layout using Bootstrap.
